# Bhreia

This repository contains the source code for the [Bhreia.com](https://bhreia.com/) wiki. The software used to generate the wiki is [MkDocs](https://www.mkdocs.org/).

The files that generate the wiki are located in the `docs` directory.

## Running Locally

Install the latest version of Python 3 and ensure that the pip executable is [part of your PATH](https://docs.python.org/3/using/windows.html). Then run the following command to install dependencies:

```zsh
pip install mkdocs-material mkdocs-alias-plugin mkdocs-categories-plugin mkdocs-awesome-pages-plugin mdx_truly_sane_lists markdown-word-count
```

Once installed, `cd` into the root directory and run the following command to run the wiki locally:

```zsh
mkdocs serve
```
