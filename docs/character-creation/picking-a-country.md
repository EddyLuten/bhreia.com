# Picking a Country

The [world map](../assets/images/world-map-full.png) was created with distribution of various races in mind. Below follows a matching of major races present on Bhreia with their respective countries or regions as well as a list of races matched to the countries where they hold a majority. Go to the country's page for common background details that your character would likely know.

## Scourges

If a race is marked as *Scourge*, it means that these creatures are seen as a nuisance, enemy, or pest to the majority population of this country. Players choosing this race are likely to get attacked without question while residing in these places.

## Mixed Races

Any mixed race, like half-elves, can be found in places where these races could potentially overlap. They do not have their own countries with a majority rule due to the rare nature of their composition.

## What About X?

Some other races, like Goblins, may also not have a majority country to call their own due to their inability to organize, being persecuted, their wildness, or other factors.

Just because your race is not listed under a country entry, does not mean that your character can't originate from this place. Bhreia is mixed enough that any race can be found in any country. This list is simply meant to point out the most common races in these places.
