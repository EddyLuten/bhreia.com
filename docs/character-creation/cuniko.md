# Cuniko

Friendly to all and obvious about their feelings, Cunikos are a doglike humanoid race that can be found almost anywhere Humans settle. While found all over Bhreia, Cunikos are not a majority race in any country, though there are several smaller regions within countries that have a Cuniko majority. Lately, an infectious disease has plagued a small portion of the Cuniko population, slowly turning them insane and overly aggressive before killing them.

### Rabid Cuniko {:.stats .sub}

Poor thing. You've been infected with a disease that slowly dissolves your brain and turns you into a dangerous lunatic. There is no cure for this disease, but it might be possible to slow its progression. You retain all of the base Cuniko traits, but with these substitutions:
