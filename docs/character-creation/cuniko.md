Friendly to all and obvious about their feelings, Cunikos are a doglike humanoid race that can be found almost anywhere Humans settle. While found all over Bhreia, Cunikos are not a majority race in any country, though there are several smaller regions within countries that have a Cuniko majority. Lately, an infectious disease has plagued a small portion of the Cuniko population, slowly turning them insane and overly aggressive before killing them.

## Cuniko Traits {:.stats}

Additionally, you can use an action to pick up on the **scent** of a specific item or creature within 100 ft. of you. Once you pick up on the scent you will know the approximate distance of the item or creature (100 ft., 50 ft., 30 ft., or 10 ft.), but not its exact location. You will lose the scent if you break your **Concentration** (uses Spell Concentration rules). This may not be applicable to items or creatures that don't emit scent trails.
{:.ability}

**Nasty Nipper.** Your teeth are a natural weapon (watch out where you chomp those things!), which you can use to make unarmed strikes. If you hit, you deal *Piercing* damage equal to 1d6 + your Strength modifier.
{:.ability}

**Feline Foes.** There's something about cats and catlike creatures that just rubs you the wrong way.
{:.ability}

**Loyal Companion.** The friends you make, you make for life. If a creature attacks your friend, you become protective and are able to use the **Nasty Nipper** attack with 1d10 instead of 1d6 against this creature.
{:.ability}

**Languages.** You can speak, read, and write Common and one other language of your choice.
{:.ability}

### Rabid Cuniko {:.stats .sub}

Poor thing. You've been infected with a disease that slowly dissolves your brain and turns you into a dangerous lunatic. There is no cure for this disease, but it might be possible to slow its progression. You retain all of the base Cuniko traits, but with these substitutions:
{:.ability}

**Ability Score Increase.** Your Strength score increases by 1, your Dexterity score increases by 1, your Charisma is reduced by 1, and your Intelligence score is reduced by 1.
{:.ability}

**Age.** Your disease will kill you in 1d4+1 years unless slowed.
{:.ability}

**Alignment.** Depending on how far the disease has progressed, these Cunikos can have any alignment.
{:.ability}

**Rabid.** Due to your illness, you're often not in control of your faculties and have a strong urge to seek out other Cunikos and tear them to shreds with your bare teeth. Whenever you meet another Cuniko, you must make a DC 15 WIS saving throw to prevent yourself from attacking.
{:.ability}

**Infectious.** If making an attack with **Nasty Nipper** against another Cuniko, your target must make a DC 15 CON saving throw or become infected as well.
{:.ability}

**Dribbling Dolt.** The disease has affected your ability to retain saliva in your mouth and for some reason, it seems to froth around your lips.
{:.ability}
