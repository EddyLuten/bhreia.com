## Divine Manipulation

If you wish, feel free to choose **one** Divine Manipulation, any of which provide a benefit as well as a detriment. List it under Features & Traits in your character sheet.

But beware: choosing one of these Divine Manipulations will create an enternal bond between you and that deity. Other deities are also keenly aware of this bond and may treat you differently depending on their relationship with your divine manipulator.

### Child of Melora {:.stats}

At your birth, [Melora](../deities/melora.md) imbued your spirit with a strong connection to the natural world.
{:.stat}

**Child of Nature.** You get a +1 to Nature (INT) skill checks and have Advantage on Nature skill checks while in the wilderness.
{:.stat}

**Moral Grasp.** Before making any unprovoked attack against a Beast or Plant that does not pose a threat, make a DC 10 INT saving throw to see if your morals will let you.
{:.stat}

### Brother's Witness {:.stats}

While he's a stranger to you, the [Brother](../deities/bhreias-brother.md)'s influence is strong while you're visible to him; and he's always watching.
{:.stat}

**Watchful Eye.** (Darkvision) You can see in dim light within 60 feet of you as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were dim light. *However*, you only have this ability while you retain visiblity to the sky. Once you can no longer see the sun or a moon, it takes five minutes for your darkvision to wear off.
{:.stat}

**Unwatched Sanity.** If you can't see the brother's eyes, that also means he can't see you. You take disadvantage on Wisdom saving throws while the sun or a moon are not visible to you.

### Divine Harmony {:.stats}

Some time during your life, you've produced a performance so beautiful that [Cauda](../deities/cauda.md) himself was moved to tears of joy. He decided to suffuse your soul into the divine harmony that binds him and his followers.

### The Reaper {:.stats}

Your skills in sending spirits to [Dhoutr's](../deities/dhoutr.md) realm have not gone unnoticed. The dark one's focus is upon you.
{:.stat}

**Soul Harvester.** After having given the final blows during combat to at least two creatures within a 24-hour period, Dhoutr encourages you to send him more souls by giving your a +1 bonus to Attack *and* Damage rolls for 12 hours.
{:.stat}

**Champion of Carnage.** If Soul Harvester is activated two days in a row, your next long rest will require a DC 13 WIS saving throw or your soul will spend the entirety of the rest in Dhoutr's realm. Here you are celebrated as a champion of carnage for the duration of the rest, will not receive its benefits, and gain a level of Exhaustion.
{:.stat}

### Savior of Souls {:.stats}

At some point in your past, your life was saved from certain death. [Primani](../deities/primani.md) wants to ensure that you no longer squander the soul they have graciously provided to you.
{:.stat}

**Death Defier.** You have advantage on Death Saving throws.
{:.stat}

**Life Preserver.** Unless the survival of your opponent presents a grave threat (use your judgment), you must use or encourage in others non-lethal damage whenever possible. If this commandment is not observed, Primani may punish you by taking away Death Defier or reversing its effect.
