## The First Age: Primordial Deities

Years 1 through 1000.

The primordial deity [**Bhreia**](../deities/bhreia.md) and her **twin brother** (whose name has been lost) are spontaneously born and give form to the earth and the sky, respectively. After some time of going through their daily cycles, both realize that they are very lonely, especially at night when they have to spend time away from each other. Feeling a mutual emptiness, they create a third deity, **Melora**, to keep them both company. But when Melora springs to life, she sees the barren world and is terrified its vast emptiness. Between the time it takes to inhale and exhale her first breath, she runs across Bhreia's surface and covers it in woodlands, plants, and vast oceans.

Bhreia is bursting with joy seeing so much life erupt upon her and becomes the closest of friends with Melora. It all fills her with so much joy that she and Melora create a fourth deity, **Primani** who fills the world with the life of beasts great and small, both land as well as water dwelling.

Meanwhile, Bhreia's twin brother is seething with jealousy as the vast majority of life doesn't come anywhere close to him and he can only watch it all from far away. Furthermore, neither Bhreia nor Melora are spending much time with him now that they're so preoccupied with their little creatures and plants. One sunset, he's fed up with them all and decides to stay away until they include him in their jubilation. Life begins to wither and die without the brother's light and Primani begs him to return. He tells Primani that he's still lonely wants life of his own to keep him company. Primani promises to send the spirits of the animals that die to him. He accepts and returns in the morning.

After a while, the brother realizes that his workload has increased tremendously. Not only is he responsible for the day and the night sky, but now he also has to manage all the spirits of the deceased beasts and grows resentful again. He approaches Primani and tells them to remove the souls from the beasts so he may rest. Primani refuses outright. The brother, in his anger, hurriedly constructs a new deity of his own. Flawed and corrupted, **Dhoutou** slithers from the brother's dark nightly form and penetrates into Bhreia where he lays at her core. The brother immediately sends Dhoutou the spirits of the dead and rests again.

When Bhreia awakes in the morning, she feels ill and weakens to the point where she can no longer hold her form. Her shape breaks and shifts to form the islands and continents. When Primani attempts to create a new beast, something terrible happens.
