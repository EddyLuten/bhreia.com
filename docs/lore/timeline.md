# Timeline

!!! info
    This page is still a work in progress, but the broad strokes are there.

An over-simplification of the commonly known timeline and creation mythology of the world. These stories were verbally passed down through the generations until writing systems were developed. Every race has their own flavor of creation mythology, but this is distilled version of details agreed on by most.

The passage of time is measured in intervals of 1000 years named Ages (or Aeons). See [calendar](../etcetera/calendar.md) for more information about time.

## The First Age: Primordial Deities

Years 1 through 1000.

The primordial deity [**Bhreia**](../deities/bhreia.md) and her **twin brother** (whose name has been lost) are spontaneously born and give form to the earth and the sky, respectively. After some time of going through their daily cycles, both realize that they are very lonely, especially at night when they have to spend time away from each other. Feeling a mutual emptiness, they create a third deity, **Melora**, to keep them both company. But when Melora springs to life, she sees the barren world and is terrified its vast emptiness. Between the time it takes to inhale and exhale her first breath, she runs across Bhreia's surface and covers it in woodlands, plants, and a vast ocean surrounding the super-continent, named Melora's Grasp.

Bhreia is bursting with joy seeing so much life erupt upon her and becomes the closest of friends with Melora. It all fills her with so much joy that she and Melora create a fourth deity, **Primani** who fills the world with the life of beasts great and small, both land as well as water dwelling.

Meanwhile, Bhreia's twin brother is seething with jealousy as the vast majority of life doesn't come anywhere close to him and he can only watch it all from far away. Furthermore, neither Bhreia nor Melora are spending much time with him now that they're so preoccupied with their little creatures and plants. One sunset, he's fed up with them all and decides to stay away until they include him in their jubilation. Life begins to wither and die without the brother's light and Primani begs him to return. He tells Primani that he's still lonely wants life of his own to keep him company. Primani promises to send the spirits of the animals that die to him. He accepts and returns in the morning.

The gods continue to create more deities for each of the newly created domains: wind, love, seasons, fire, time, etc. All of these deities in turn create lesser deities and Bhreia is soon brimming with life and stage to the many adventures of the gods.

After a while, the brother realizes that his workload has increased tremendously. Not only is he responsible for the day and the night sky, but now he also has to manage all the spirits of the deceased beasts and grows resentful again. Soon he finds himself managing more spirits than there are living creatures upon Bhreia. Has he been tricked? He believes it with his entire being and can practically hear Primani's shrill laughter echo in his mind.

On the eve of the Second Age, he approaches Primani and tells them to take back the souls from the beasts so he may rest. Primani refuses outright telling him that this is what he wanted; some company. The brother, in a fit of anger, hurriedly constructs a new deity out of the spirits of all the creatures that have died so far, destroying them and amalgamating the result into writhing mess of pain. Flawed and corrupted, **Dhoutr**'s ghastly shape slithers from the brother's nightly cloak and penetrates into Bhreia where he lays at her core in a protective shell of his own creation; a **dark plane** of existence entirely Dhoutr's domain. The brother immediately sends Dhoutr the newly deceased spirits and rests again, now content with being alone.

## The Second Age: Imperfect Creatures

Years 1001 through 2000.

When Bhreia awakens on the first morning of the Second Age, she feels ill and weakened to the point where she can no longer hold her form. She knows that something is different, but not exactly *what*. As she moves to greet Primani and Melora, her shape breaks and painfully shifts to form the **islands and continents**. With Dhoutr rotting her from the inside, it takes all of her energy to prevent herself from disintegrating altogether and she is doomed to do so until the end of time.

Primani and Melora eventually learn to live without Bhreia and together continue creating life upon the world. However, it seems that each time they create a new creature, it is impure in some way. Dhoutr's essence now manifests itself in all creatures except for the wild beasts, who remain pure of spirit. The first of the **Peoples** created, **Elves**, live long lives in harmony with nature, but have jealous tendencies and can occasionally be cruel. While Primani seems happy enough to create life, Melora notices a tendency in these creatures to disrupt nature, her domain. Each successive People seems more flawed than the previous. Especially their most recent creation, **Humans**, have a wicked desire to consume their environment in a wild rush to make something of their short lives. After many years and many attempts to create a better creature, Melora realizes the folly of their enterprise and stops helping Primani.

On their own, Primani doesn't fare much better and creates the least worthy of all the creatures, the **Monsters** that plague the world. Most of these creatures seem to have more of Dhoutr in them than Primani. Crestfallen, Primani retreats to leave creation up to the other deities and focuses on supporting life instead of creating it.

The monsters grow countless in their numbers and Bhreia's brother smiles at this development caused by the influence of his creation. At the end of the Second Age, it seems that there are more monsters upon the world than any other creature and the tensions between the various races balance on a blade's edge.
