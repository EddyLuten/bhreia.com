# The Wasting

The Wasting is a non-communicable disease caused by unknown factors. It seemingly affects any humanoid of any race. It presents itself in several stages:

1. Weakness: the patient always feels tired, but no matter how much they sleep, they don't recover
2. Coughing Blood: the patient begins to develop a persistent cough, which soon results in the coughing of blood
3. Extreme Weight Loss: the patient loses weight at a rate too fast to regain
4. Immobility: due to the patient not having enough muscle mass to move, they become immobile

After the final stage, the patient soon perishes.
