# Grave Desire

??? "DM Only"
    This is the curse that Tiran has.

Grave Desire is a curse that causes a desire for blood, killing, and eventually, one for the grave. It is generally bound to an object, and inflicted upon the victim through touch. Over time, the curse will become more powerful and requires the victim to feed the object more and more blood.
