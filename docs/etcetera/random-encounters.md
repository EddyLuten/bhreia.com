## The Con-Artist

A con-artist tries to sell the group a shiny green stone, which feels warm to the touch. He claims that he's been told that the stone contains the immortal soul of a young woman and acts as a ward against evil spirits. Or, they can set it free if they want.

He wants to sell it for 20 gp, but is willing to let it go for 10 if pushed.

An arcana check will reveal that the stone is magical, a **DC 18 Arcana** check will reveal that it likely is an illusion of sorts.

The artist has cast [Prestidigitation](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Prestidigitation) on the stone to heat it up. The effect will stop after an hour.
