## Stylites

Main article: [[dhoutr]].

Dhoutr, the deity of Death, has many followers across Bhreia who congregate in temples commonly found in large population centers. There are two main distinguishing features of these temples: first, they are constructed from oily black stone, simply enough named *Black Stone*, and secondly, they host at least two tall pillars per temple on the temple grounds.

These fifty-foot pillars are the final destinations for the most devout followers of Dhoutr, the *Santekka*, or *Stylites* in the common tongue. The Stylites ascend these pillars and remain seated atop them until they die from starvation.

Occasionally, elemental forces remove Stylites from their pillars., When this happens, they must beg to be re-seated by other followers if they can no longer physically ascend. Stylites must survive for at least two days to fulfill their holy duty or be doomed to wander the infinite fields outside Dhoutr's inner sanctuary, forever looking for a way inside.

Fun fact: If lightning strikes a Stylite and kills them, this death is seen as most unfavorable. Dhoutr, or so the followers claim, requires suffering since life is suffering. A lack of suffering in this life means eternal suffering in the afterlife.
