## Synopsis

After finishing the puzzle room, Sah-Sauj was pulled aside by Borlok as you descended deeper down into the ever warming earth. He seemed to probe Sah-Sauj for details on his involvement with Amalchi, and once he deemed that Sah-Sauj was an impostor in his eyes, he blocked you all from going further. However, you easily subdued him and knocked him unconscious.

After Borlok was tied up and undone of his clothing, a scarred woman appeared holding a child made of soil, who Wolf recognized as the lady he met in the forest a few nights ago; the earth goddess Bhreia. She implored Sah-Sauj to renounce Amalchi as his deity. He did so reluctantly while not entirely understanding what was happening. Bhreia turned Sah-Sauj's holy symbol into a branch with 10 leaves, it purpose unknown at this point. She offered everyone an embrace, which Sah-Sauj and Tiran accepted. She then laid her child on top of Borlok, embraced both of them, combining them all together into an amalgamation of soil, and leaching into the ground. And she was gone.

You all continued down the lava tube tunnel until hitting a dark cavernous space with a lava pool at its center. A pile of blood-drained Macoyii lay rotting at its entrance. At the center of the pool stood a stone spire, feeding streams lava down. There didn't seem to be a way across the pool to the spire that you could discern in the low light conditions.

After some looking around the cave, you found five spaces carved into the walls of this cave. Each similar in size and each conceiling a lever in different ways. When all of them were pulled, an obsidian slab rose from the lava, forming a bridge to the spire.

However, from an opening in the spire, a blue robed figure appeared. You recognized her as Rhea Feldspar, the innkeeper's wife. Upon seeing you, she asked "where's Borlok?"

And that's where we left off.

??? danger "DM: Borlok & Sah-Sauj"
    Borlok will pull Sah-Sauj aside and tell him that:

    - Says: He wouldn't have thought that someone like Sah-Sauj would be [_the fifth_](../../adventures/dauriels-mansion/organizations/cult-of-amalchi.md), but then again he doesn't get to chose who gets to remember His name
    - Shows him his brand on the inside of his index finger, the dark eye of Amalchi
    - If Sah-Sauj doesn't spook him:
      - He will tell him that he thought and hoped Dauriel would have been the last
      - He will thank him for bringing the sacrifices
    - If Sah-Sauj spooks him:
      - Will become more defensive, clamp up
      - Will ask Sah-Sauj about the ritual
      - If pushed, he will prevent them from going forward
    - On his body, his loincloth conceals a bag of holding:
      - Ironstone Forged Greataxe (**+1 Greataxe**)
      - A note: "Pasha Yaraxil. Dragonborn. Affected."
        - Affected by the event in [[pasha|Finippicay]]
        - His sacrifice would have had special significance
      - A light blue robe
      - A golden dagger (the same stuff that was in the tomb)
      - An old letter, crumpled, folded many times:
        - My beloved Borlok. I hope you and our darling baby Hurq arrived safely in Rivoni Springs. If you have been writing me, I have not yet received word and I pray for your safety. Please hurry back home soon with the healing water, my illness is worsening. Your father is less willing than you are to look after a human of poor constitution. Tell Hurq I love him. - Riva

??? danger "DM: Mother Earth"
    - Meeting Bhreia again, she will warn them
      - "My brother is here, I feel him." She will look at Sah-Sauj. "Cleric, denounce your allegiance to Amalchi or all living creatures in this world will suffer for a thousand years."
      - She will offer herself as a replacement god and will require no worship, only the just treatment of all that dwell upon her surface.
        - Sah-Sauj's holy symbol will melt into blood if he does
        - She will give him a tree branch with 10 living oak leaves on it
          - Staff of Healing
        - She will bless everyone else except for Borlok if he's alive.
          - She embraces everyone, whispering to Wolf that "the orc is your foe"
          - Bhreia's Embrace:
            - +1 to AC for until your next long rest
            - 1d10+4 temporary Hit Points
            - Instantly healed to max HP
            - All expended spell slots restored
            - +1 to Nature checks permanently
      - Borlok will freak if he sees her and attack
      - If he strikes her with his axe, it will cleave her and her child, dropping a pile of soil onto the ground
      - Before she disappears in ANY form, she will say "don't let him ascend."
