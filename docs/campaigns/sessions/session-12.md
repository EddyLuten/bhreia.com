## Synopsis

None yet.

??? danger "DM Only"
    Find an opportune moment, maybe toward the end of the session. A young blue dragon flies in from the east.

    !!! cite "Flavor"
        Hovering over the tree line, a young blue dragon with a single piercing white eye in its head directs its gaze to Agorius. You feel the gusts of wind as it flaps its mighty wings, opens its mouth, and speaks in Draconic.

    !!! cite "Translated"
        Wizard, conclude your business here and travel east. You are taking too long and Father needs your presence.

    !!! cite "Draconic"
        levethix chiilipen dout drinlekih tenpiswo vur ossalur haruhe. Wux claxir kiri drong vur opsola rigluinic dout whaisih.

    It will notice Pasha.

    !!! cite "Flavor"
        When it concludes, it turns its head and looks directly at Pasha. You feel its piercing eye and a strange, old, familiarity. It once again opens it mouth to speak, but says only two words.

    !!! cite "Translated"
        Traitor brother.

    !!! cite "Draconic"
        Isthasy neban.

    You see through its maw omething beginning to glow in its throat, as it begins to fliy directly toward you. Roll for initiative.

    When it dies, the sky flickers between night and day for a moment, but the perpetual day continues. However, now visible in the sky is one of the moons, low on on the horizon.
