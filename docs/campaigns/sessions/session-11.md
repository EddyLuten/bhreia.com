    For the last hour or so you've been enjoying Hurq's turkey stew in the boys' cave and it honestly tastes pretty good. Though, you're not entirely sure if the chunks of meat are actually turkey.

    While you ate, the boys told you what happened during the time you were away. The blue dragon rose from the center of town, and destroyed it entirely on its way out. It seemed to take a special interest in obliterating Dauriel's mansion. A thousand people are dead or missing and a camp has been set up south-west of town that houses both survivors as well as family members waiting to hear anything about their loved ones. Every day, bodies have been pulled from the crater where Cauldin's Point used to be, though fewer lately ([[crater]]).

    Hurq tells you that when you're ready, he'll take you to a spot where you can properly see what happened.

    Piles of rubble emerge from the calm surface of the water that fills the crater before you. One of the oldest and most historically significant places in Korbantir now lies broken at the bottom of a hole, overgrowing with plantlife which thrives in this age of perpetual sunshine.

    You can clearly tell that during his ascension through the bowels of the town, Amalchi made a point of making an example of those who dared to exist in his path. The level of destruction didn't nearly have to be *this* extensive. Innocent or guilty, old or young, nobody was spared the wrathful fury of this deity.

    But, signs of life remain. In the south-west, against the edge of the ancient forest you see plumes of smoke trail into the bright sky from what you assume to be the survivors camp that the boys had mentioned.
