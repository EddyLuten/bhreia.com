# Golden Signet Ring

**Owner:** [[wolf]]

A golden ring found on the skeletal hand gripping a lever in the caves below Cauldin's Point.

Slightly bent and scratched probably due to the rocks that fell onto its previous owner, but still quite pretty. A plain golden band terminates in a signet embossed with the letters DL in a flourished script.
