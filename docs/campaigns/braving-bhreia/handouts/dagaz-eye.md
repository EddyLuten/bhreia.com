# 🔐 Dagaz' Eye

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Upon his death, Dagaz leaves behind his single blazing eye.

It radiates light in a radius of 25 ft.

## Revealed

Any creature holding the eye up to their own will be able to see any magical effect within 100 ft., without the barrier limitations of spells such as [detect magic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Detect%20Magic).

However, due to its divine powers, after use, the creature will go blind for ten minutes.
