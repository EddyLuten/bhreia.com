# Ironstone Forge Greataxe

**Owner:** [[tiran]]

Forged in the fires of the [[ironstone-forge]] near Cauldin's Point, this Greataxe is made from the most refined steel that can be found in Korbantir. When you hold it up to the light, it shimmers slightly blue.

You have a +1 bonus to attack and damage rolls made with this weapon.
