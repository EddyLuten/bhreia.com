# Branch With 10 Leaves

**Owner:** [[sah-sauj]]

Bhreia turned your holy symbol into a branch with ten oak leaves.

You don't quite know what it is except for... well, a stick.

??? danger "DM: Supplemental Facts"
    Requires Attunement by a Bard, Cleric, or Druid

    This staff has 10 Charges. While holding it, you can use an action to expend 1 or more of its Charges to cast one of the following Spells from it, using your spell save DC and Spellcasting ability modifier:

    - Cure Wounds (1 charge per Spell Level, up to 4th)
    - Lesser Restoration (2 charges)
    - or mass Cure Wounds (5 charges)

    Upon using each charge, a leave shrivels and drops from the branch.

    The staff regains 1d6 + 4 expended Charges daily at dawn, a leaf grows back where it was expended. If you expend the last charge, roll a d20. On a 1, the staff shrivels and won't work for another week.
