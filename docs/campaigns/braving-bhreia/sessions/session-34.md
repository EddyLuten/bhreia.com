# Session 34

**Date:** December 13, 2023

- Pasha, Sebastian, and Gadot kicked off the ship
- Pasha noticed that Callum's hand was clenched tightly
- They met up with Sah-Sauj in the crowd on the dock
- They plan to go find Chickadee, perhaps at Gigglemug's
- Wolf and Tiran escaped
- Tiran turned Wolf invisible and disguised himself as a city guard
- While invisible, Wolf joins the group, remaining invisible
- Tiran, in disguise, joins the guards who are inspecting Callum's corpse
- Able to fool the detective present, he found a water-damaged note in his hand
- Meet me at the something-something
- The detective thanked him for finding the evidence and told him to take the corpse away
- Tiran carries the corpse with the detective and places it in a wagon
- The rider tells him to help take it to the morgue
- The rest of you follow the wagon at a distance
- The wagon rider takes Tiran to the Aldarion Unlimited compound
- They take the body down into a subterranean morgue
- The driver thanked Tiran and left to go fetch the next body
- Tiran went back down into the morgue, still disguised
- In Callum's pocket, Tiran found a flask containing a slightly glowing yellow liquid
- While waiting for Tiran, the rest of you observed the Temple of Dhoutr
- Black-robed priests came and went, some disappearing in portals before entering the temple proper
- The portals linger for a few seconds before disappearing
- The black-robed priests are very similar to the one you fought at Korban's monument
- Tiran and Wolf got a room at a nearby motel and stayed there, out of sight from anyone who might recognize them during the day
- Sah-Sauj, Pasha, Gadot, and Sebastian went to Gigglemug's to find Chickadee
- They got a table, ordered some wine, and by bribing the hostess, found out that Chickadee was staying there
- While Sah-Sauj distracted the bored Half-Elf at the front desk, Gadot sneaked past and up the stairs where he found Chickadee in her room
- Gadot told Chickadee that they found Callum dead. She began to cry as he explained the circumstances of his death. Shocked to hear about the hole right through his chest.
- Downstairs, in the restaurant part of the inn, the detective from the dock arrived, trailed by two guards. He walks up to the manager, who points toward the staircase.
- Pasha turned to Sebastian and said, "Hit me."
- They brawled in an attempt to distract the guards, who came over to the ruckus
- The detective and the manager, however, resumed up the staircase.
- Sah-Sauj, Pasha, and Sebastian ran out of the restaurant.
- Godot, hearing the commotion downstairs and footsteps coming towards the room warns Chickadee that something might be up.
- There's a knock on the door, followed by "Miss Chickadee, please open up."

And that's where we left off.
