## Synopsis

Dauriel had a brief enough window of consciousness to give Sah-Sauj some information on what happened to Moreus. He told him that 35 years ago, deep in the tunnels below the town, Moreus was supposed to be a vessel for a powerful entity to corporealize into this world. However, Dauriel was able to lock the entity's energy into the orb and save Moreus' life, even though his memory was wiped empty. He believed that the entity had been calling to Moreus from the orb, and that's why he had crushed it, setting it free to continue its plans.

Dauriel passed out and you all began heading down to the basement where Moreus' body was being led through. His body phased through a wooden door that was locked with a music based puzzle. After only a single wrong entry, Tiran solved the puzzle by completing the tune played by the satyr on your first night in town and selecting the light blue color.

The door opened, revealing a long dark natural tunnel formed by a lava tube. You all went down the tunnel until hitting a section that was collapsed, and slowly filling with water. Sah-Sauj and Tiran were able to secure a way through the water by tying a rope and closing the hole that would have filled the tunnel with groundwater.

You continued even deeper until the air thinned, but strangely the temperature increased. You arrived at a widened section where the natural structure gave way to a flat stone wall engraved with a strange symbol and two pairs of hand imprints. Sah-Sauj and Pasha put their hands on the imprints and found themselves in control of two large stone statues, tasked with solving a puzzle. A few hours later, and with the input of everyone in the party, the puzzle was solved, but the way back up seemed to be lost.

Standing on the other side of the stone room, the only way available seemed to be deeper down the tunnel.
