# Session 21

**Date:** Tuesday, August 17, 2022 @ 9:00 PM CT

**Audio:** None. The audio was bad.

## Synopsis

After the guards cooled off and eventually left the campground in the morning, you set out onto the road east once again. Throughout the day, Wolf noticed a dragon flying overhead again, followed by two wyrmlings. He took the group off the main road and through the trees in an effort to remain hidden, but as torrential rains began to pour down, the path became muddy and forced you back onto the main road.

Towards the end of the afternoon, you came upon a portion of the road washed away by the rains. As Wolf went ahead and investigated, a blue dragon and two wyrmlings approached over the treeline and began their attacks. They targeted Pasha, and the dragon again insinuated that he betrayed his father and neglected to worship him.

After a few bloody battle rounds, one of the wyrmlings fell slain, but the battle is far from over. And that's where we left off.
