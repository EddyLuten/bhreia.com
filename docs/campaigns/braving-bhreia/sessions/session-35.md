- Chickadee climbs down the building and meets Sebastian
- Gadot jumps down, they all run off
- they go to caravan inn
- Gadot smells them out and they meet back up

- You plan to go to investigate
- Tiran cuts off Wolf's beard
- decide to go back to Gigglemugs, get a lawyer for Tom, and investigate the alley where Chickadee and Callum bought the potion
- Tiran, in disguise, visited Gigglemugs and chatted with the bored attendant there
- After some bribes, he told Tiran that an elderly man with black hair, a long beard, and black robes had delivered the note to Callum the night before
- He looked and smelled like a nerd
- On the way to find a lawyer for Tom, you stopped at the Temple of Dhoutr
- Pasha showed Tiran that the outfits of the priests matched the description given to him
- Sah-Sauj, interested in the shiny portal, decided to go and touch one
- Wolf was walking nearby and noticed his friends on the other side of the Temple grounds
- When Sah-Sauj entered the portal, a massive explosion shook the world
- Followed by a sphere of blue crackling energy that consumed everyone and everything near the Temple
- Sah-Sauj found himself in a black void, with the corpse of Bhreia's fetal form dying in his backpack
- Brother's voice rang out in the darkness. It said, "Thank You."
- After being spat out by a portal the rest of you arrived in a strange landscape full of rocks and mushrooms
