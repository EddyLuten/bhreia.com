While fighting Arya, Ix became lost in the pool and disappeared below the surface. Arya fought back and petrified Tiran, Gadot, and Wolf. While petrified, Tiran took blow after blow from Arya, chunking away at his stony form. Eventually, Sebastian was able to strike the killing blow while looking away and killed Arya.

In the cave.

- Seb finds a silver dagger on Arya's body
- Also two gold wedding bands
- Tiran finds various corpses in the back of the caves. Cut apart at the joints.
- The pond's glow is fading. The eggs sink.
- Tiran took a dragon egg.
- Eventually, the glow disappeared entirely and the viscosity disappeared.
- Gadot found a THING under a wobbly rock in the cave.
- The chickens seem to be reverted to normal. Tiran still stabbed them to death.
- Sah-Sauj buried the chickens in the cave and spoke a little prayer.
- Junior killed one of the chickens.

Out the cave & Midway

- Clank tells Tiran that he has 15 miles left in the tank and will need days to recharge given the current solar conditions.
- Arrive back in Midway and take Arya's body to the inn.
- The little museum is boarded up
- Garacan is unstoned, missing a small piece of his horn, head in hands
- Garacan hugs Tiran after finding out and says free drinks and lodging for life
- After inquiring, Pasiphae, Garacan's wife, hands Tiran the keys to Ix's room.
- Sah-Sauj grabbed them, ran off, and opened the room.
- In a sack: rations, a small paper note with an address and a password hint.
