## Synopsis

Before giving Dr. Anton Malchi his last rites and cremating his body, Sah-Sauj searched him for anything useful and found a pen and a wristwatch. In the cave, you also found some drawings, and a English to Common codex that the doctor was working on. You also took his music box and some tapes that were laying around, including the tape containing a very confused testament given by the late doctor. Eventually, Pasha, Tiran, and Sah-Sauj made their way back to the Ironstone Forge where everyone went to sleep except for Tiran.

Instead of sleeping, he stayed up to work on his robot, which he was able to bring back to life. After some introductions between him and the machine, he went off to bed and the robot went into a defense mode, which seemed like a good idea at the time. However, when Gadot woke up the next morning, the robot sensed a potential threat and began attacking him immediately. Eventually, Tiran woke up from the noise and ordered the machine to stand down, but not before souring Gadot to the seemingly racist device.

It was the morning of Wolf's trial, and after some breakfast, you went on your way to meet with the magistrate. Once you arrived at the camp, he informed you of the charges and told you that you had an hour to prepare. Within that hour, Gadot was able to confront Burron Piquette about the charges and had also learned that the halfling had a shifty looking conspirator who called him Jerry. Under the guise of getting 800 gold pieces to secure a cash settlement for the halfling, both parties agreed to an extension to raise the funds. Wolf asked for a few days, but the magistrate told you that you had 24 hours to get your things in order.

And that's where we left off.
