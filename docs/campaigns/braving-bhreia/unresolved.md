# 🔐 Unresolved Storylines

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Storylines that have been opened up, but not yet resolved.

## Marram

Marram is dangled in front of the group, though they will have to face the threat in Cauldin's Point first. How could they possibly help out with the genocide that's happening there? They have acquired a [[marram-map-partial|partial map]] of Marram.

## Gadot's Dad

Gadot's dad (Phillipe) is in Marram on Dauriel's orders. Once Dauriel is out of the picture, Phillipe will have no more contact. Does he become stranded?

## Phidippus and Dauriel

Dauriel suspects that Phidippus may have influenced him somehow to invite him to the party. Is it true? And why does Phidippus want to be there? Will he show up?

## Dauriel and Cauldin's Artifacts

The gang gave Dauriel the artifacts they found (drawings + journal) and Dauriel would look into them, but hasn't as of yet.
