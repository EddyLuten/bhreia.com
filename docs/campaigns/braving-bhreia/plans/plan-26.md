- Enter the cave

## The Cave

The dragons won't attack unless they get too close.

The pool isn't water. It's sky, it's glowing with sunlight. It acts like quicksand. Only Pasha can wade through it.

!!! quote "Quicksand Rules"
    When a creature enters quicksand it sounds 1d4+1 feet. On its turn it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged it can escape by using it's action and succeeding a strength check of dc 10+number of feet the creature has sunk.

    A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by using it's action and succeeding a strength check of dc 5 + number of feet the target creature has sunk

!!! quote "Drowning"
    After 1+(con bonus) minutes of holding your breath underwater you fall unconscious, your hit points fall to 0, and you can then survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). After that, you begin making your death saving throws as per the standard rules. However, if you become stable there is a problem. If you are still under water you can’t remain stable. So you must start making death saving throws again. This continues until you die unless you are saved in some way.

## Battle

The dragons will attack if they feel threatened. The hatchlings will gather around the wyrmlings, who will protect them and the eggs.

Four rounds into the battle, Ix will show up.
