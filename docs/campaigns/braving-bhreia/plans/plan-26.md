# üîê Plan: Session 25

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

- [Recap](../sessions/session-25.md)
- New interview format: Sah-Sauj
- Enter the cave

## The Cave

The dragons won't attack unless they get too close.

The pool isn't water. It's sky, it's glowing with sunlight. It acts like quicksand. Only Pasha can wade through it.

!!! quote "Quicksand Rules"
    When a creature enters quicksand it sounds 1d4+1 feet. On its turn it sinks another 1d4 feet. As long as the creature isn't completely submerged it can escape by using it's action and succeeding a strength check of dc 10+number of feet the creature has sunk.

    A creature can pull another creature within its reach out of a quicksand pit by using it's action and succeeding a strength check of dc 5 + number of feet the target creature has sunk

!!! quote "Drowning"
    After 1+(con bonus) minutes of holding your breath underwater you fall unconscious, your hit points fall to 0, and you can then survive for a number of rounds equal to your Constitution modifier (minimum 1 round). After that, you begin making your death saving throws as per the standard rules. However, if you become stable there is a problem. If you are still under water you can‚Äôt remain stable. So you must start making death saving throws again. This continues until you die unless you are saved in some way.

## Battle

The dragons will attack if they feel threatened. The hatchlings will gather around the wyrmlings, who will protect them and the eggs.

Four rounds into the battle, Ix will show up.

## Aftermath

**Arya** is hiding in the cave, **Ix** will find her if nobody else does. She's tired, hungry, and scared. She claims that she was under some sort of influence until about two days ago when she suddenly lost her powers.

A **DC 15 Insight** check will reveal that she's lying about being under an influence. She was doing this for the power that the dragon gave her.

Ix carries with him a piece of stone horn -- he broke it off Garacan's head. He knows that to undo the petrification curse, he **must kill the source**. He figured out it is Arya and will attempt to kill her.

Arya will beg for her life, Ix will debate the group if they try to intervene. He can be driven to fight.

If they search Ix, they will find a piece of paper with an address on it in Korban's Landing. This is his weapons stash.

## Midway

Back in town, depending on what happened in the cave, Garacan will be unpetrified, though missing a piece of horn.

## On The Road

They encounter a man named Theophilus (Theo) Picot, a fisherman from Korban's Landing whose cart has fallen over.

A **DC 10 Nature** check by Pasha will reveal that the smell coming from the cart is squid.

If they help Theo, they may see that this is only a small piece of squid tentacle -- a giant squid. It takes up the entire cart and is stapped down with thick ropes to prevent it from shifting.

Theo is taking the squid arm to Leecham where there's a professor who might be able to tell more about the arm. The professor's name is Kenkar (an anagram for Kraken).

Strange creatures have been seen in the seas as of late, this arm was cut off by a crew trying to prevent whatever owned the arm from capsizing their ship.

Theo hasn't had any encounters himself, but there are plenty of stories being told.
