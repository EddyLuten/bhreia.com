# 🔐 Plan: Session 13

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Ask for fun fact: Sah-Sauj

## Player Cues

- Pasha is being looked at funny by people because he's a Dragonborn
  - After Amalchi, people are mistrustful of Dragonborn, mostly humans
  - Londrina can tell him that ever since the disaster, people have been looking at Dragonborn in a distrustful way
- Wolf is thinking about making a run for it and heading home.
  - This will make the party look bad, Weslan will not appreciate this
  - The trial will still go on without him and he will be marked as an outlaw
- Sophia will ask Pasha if he noticed a key while sleeping in her father's office. She went in there today to take a look around, but the place reminded her too much of her father. This may be an opportunity for Gadot to unlock the chest.

## Battle Dagaz

BATTLE

When it dies, the sky flickers between night and day for a moment, but the perpetual day continues. However, now visible in the sky is one of the moons, low on on the horizon.

It disintegrates and its entire body turns to smoke, leaving behind only [[dagaz-eye]].
