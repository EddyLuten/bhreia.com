# 🔐 Plan: Session 15

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

- The roll for Gadot's forgery is **15**
- It is late at night, they arrived at 10:30, it will be around 1:00 PM now!
- Open with Tiran and Pasha arriving back at the cave, seeing Sah-Sauj standing over Anton's dead body.
- **Tiran** will likely want to boot the construct first.
- The clocks, more specifically the crystals, are focuses for [[amalchi]] to merge the material and elemental plane of air. See [[clock-crystal]].
- Today is when [[assaulted-halfling]] trial is supposed to take place!
  - The [[au]] guards are waiting on the road and will escort the group from a distance.
  - If the magistrate inspects the deeds, on failure:
    - **Wolf:** depending on his rhetoric, may get in trouble for falsifying evidence and presenting it.
    - **Burron:** If the magistrate finds out, he may (1d2) try to run.
  - In either case, if the evidence is deemed false, the charge of **robbery** will be dropped. The magistrate will concede that nobody has a proper claim to the giant goat and the state will take the goat into custody.
