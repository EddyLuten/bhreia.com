# üîê Plan: Session 28

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

- [Recap](../sessions/session-27.md)
- New interview format: Pasha

TODO

- What's up with Clank getting a signal?

## Clank's Signal

TODO

## Tiran's Wound

TODO Not healing right. His arm.

## Road Squid

(Day 6 of travel)

They encounter a man named Theophilus (Theo) Picot, a fisherman from Korban's Landing whose cart has fallen over.

A **DC 10 Nature** check by Pasha will reveal that the smell coming from the cart is squid.

If they help Theo, they may see that this is only a small piece of squid tentacle -- a giant squid. It takes up the entire cart and is stapped down with thick ropes to prevent it from shifting.

A single person will require a **DC 19 Strength** check to upright the cart or a group check of **DC 17 Strength**.

Reward: He will give them a brass token, resembling a **Square Knot**. He tells them that they can use this at **The Salt Lick** (a tavern for sailors) for a free round of drinks. "Tell 'em Theo sent ye."

Theo is taking the squid arm to Leecham where there's a professor who might be able to tell more about the arm. The professor's name is Kenkar (an anagram for Kraken).

This arm was cut off by a crew trying to prevent whatever owned the arm from capsizing their ship.

Strange creatures have been seen in the seas as of late, tales of:

- Strange pale people walking into the ocean as if taking a stroll, wearing nothing but white nightgowns
- Distant songs echoing across the waves, their lyrics incomprehensible, yet beautiful and enticing, drawing you onto the open sea
- Fins the size of ships breaching the surface, clipping the sides of ships
- And worst of all: the corpses of sailors long since drowned washing up on shore. Theo found his best friend on the beach, his body perfectly preserved. He drowned more than a decade ago.

He says that there are plenty more stories being told. All these things have been happening since the dragon attack last year. Things have been getting bananas.

## Catching Up with Tino

(Day 7 of travel)

The gang arrives at Korban's memorial in Korban's Ruin.

### The Memorial

The memorial is a weather-worn stone statue of a person on their knees, clutching their chest. It's unclear why they are clutching their chest since millennia of weather have washed away most of its features.

A **DC 15 investigation** check reveals that there's a faint engraving in Old Common (the word Amalchi is scratched out, but still legible):

> KORBAN  
> Son of Bhreia.  
> Our nation's father, slayer of Amalchi.  
> His sacrifice is salvation.

The statue and plaque are approximately 2000 years old (history check).

### Tino

The same check if **over 12** will reveal that there's a corpse behind the statue. It's that of Tino Block, the person who wanted the gang to steal a crate full of healing potions a few days ago. They are dead, succumbed to their sickness, likely only a few hours.

Their eyes are open and their face is in an expression of both pain and exhaustion. In their hands is the box that Sah-Sauj wanted so badly. Due to rigor mortis, a **DC 13 STR** check will be required to pry the box loose.
