# 🔐 Plan: Session 24

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

- [Recap](../sessions/session-23.md)
- [[interviews]]: Tiran
- Wolf follows the flock of chickens to town
- Tiran finds a new OS disk inside of Clank
- Chickens attack Midway ([[swamp-witch]])

## Clank OS

As Tiran's repairing Clank, taped to the side of Clank's internals is a CD-ROM containing a prototype operating system. This was the dangerous OS that went haywire in the other universe but will give Clank more autonomy and interactivity.

However, the CD itself is slightly damaged, so crucial parts of the program will not copy over, making the MLSD a bit unpredictable.

## After the Battle

- Garacan is petrified
  - Pasiphae, his wife, will offer a reward to "fix him"
  - Ix will offer his services
  - Pasiphae will offer 500 gold, but Ix won't risk his life for that
    - He will provide exposition that they need to kill the creature that petrified him to undo the effect
  - She ups the offer to 700, but Ix scoffs at this and goes back to bed

### Garacan's Wife

A stocky human female, blonde hair in two long braids. She's wearing a nightgown when she comes down the stairs.

- Name: Pasiphae
- Race: Human
- Age: 58

### Weary Traveler

Voice: Larry Hall from Blackbird

An old wrinkled dark red Tiefling wearing brown leathers and carrying a battle-worn scimitar. One of his horns is broken off at the scalp while the other is notched from what looks like weapon impacts. His face is lined with deep wrinkles and bright red scar tissue.

- Name: Ix
- Race: Tiefling
- Age: 86
- Bio: mercenary for hire, has been doing the work for 60 years. He's seen petrification before, though not from chickens.
