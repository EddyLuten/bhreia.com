## Quick Sah-Sauj Note

Sah-Sauj goes to bed, feeling empty. It's as if something has left him.

In the morning, he wakes up, having lost Bhreia's powers. His healing powers are gone, and Bhreia's [[branch]] has wilted and died.

## Transmission

Clank informs Tiran that a transmission is audible on the AM frequency of 1770 Mhz.

After dialing in:

!!! Quote "The Transmission"
    *--static--* can't believe there's another *--static--* I mean, what are the *--static--* *beeps in the background* my batteries are running low, but *--static--* me in Rivoni Springs if you can. I've got *--static--* near the healing baths. Just *--static--* for the antennas. And my name is Remo, which is kinda important, I *--static--*. Oh, and don't take the gondolas. They're *--static--*

!!! Quote "The Transmission Ungarbled"
    I can't believe there's another person from Earth! I mean, what are the odds? *beeps in the background* My batteries are running low, but I can broadcast another minute. Meet me in Rivoni Springs if you can. I've got a place near the healing baths. Just look for the antennas. And my name is Remo, which is kinda important, I guess. Oh, and don't take the gondolas. They're a ripoff.

The transmission ends.

## Sah-Sauj Dream

Play some light-hearted music.

> Sah-Sauj, you went to bed feeling empty and cold, but your dreams couldn't be nicer. You're flying through a deep blue sky, occasionally bursting through a fluffy cloud and you're cradling your brand new box along the way. Below, you see the ocean. Dolphins leap from the water and dance around you. "I love you, Sah-Sauj," one says and licks your cheek while you float across the curve of a beautiful rainbow.

Fred shows up:

- "Well, well, well. It sure has been a long time, Sah-Sauj. How are you?"
- He tells Sah that he misses him so much.
- He says his flirtation with Bhreia ("my sister") didn't matter.
- "All that matters is that you're back with me."
- He tells Sah that he has a present for him. "Do you want it?"
- "Will see you soon."
- If asked about the box, he says, "just say the words, darling!"
