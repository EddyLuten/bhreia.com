--8<-- "spoiler.html"

- A dragon flies overhead, followed by two wyrmlings
  - It's the same one they fought, but larger
  - They're flying slowly, maybe looking for something
- [[liquid-life]]
- Poll for S21: [Poll Link](https://whenavailable.com/event/HTPL79osnkYxunMPA)

## Guard

- Name: Vinzo de Yerba
- Employer: [[au]]
- Bio: 17 years old, male, human, originally from Cuaña
- Appearance: olive skin, black hair, thin pencil mustache
- Info:
  - They were following Wolf.
  - They noticed Leca and got backup.
  - One guard went back to Cauldin's Point to tell the magistrate
  - Things won't be good for Wolf in particular

If they let Vinzo go, he will strip off his uniform and find civilian clothing before taking off.

## Liquid Life

See [[liquid-life]] for details.

The campground is large and communal. Currently, there are:

- Tino Block with their small wagon pulled by a donkey
- Later: 3 [[au]] guards will rest there for the night with a wagon full of potions

## Dagaz Returns

Dagaz and his two children find the group and attack.

To Pasha:

- You dare carry the gift, yet not worship my father.
- Traitor, you will not escape me again.
