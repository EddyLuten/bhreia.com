## Sebastian's Flashback

We focus on a memory formed months ago, far east of Korbantir. We follow it back across the Sea of Korban, through the jungles of Rivoni, where it bridges the cruel desert known as The Passage.

Here the memory anchors firmly in the busy oasis city of Ganaroum Bak, built into the colossal sun-bleached bones of Gruumsh, the fallen Orcish god. The rememberer strides on horseback between giant rib bones into which the citizens carved their myriad dwellings. Randomly placed market stalls and innumerable people slow the horse down to a walk, and the rememberer holds tightly onto his belongings to keep safe from thieving fingers. High above, climbing the protruding rib bones, city officials stretch large sheets of red fabric to provide much-needed shade from the relentless sun. The desert desperately needs a sunset.

Woven into the crowd, Orcish pilgrims collect chips of holy bone to return home as tangible proof that their god once walked with them in this world. The once fearsome race now roams the continent in search of a sign of better days - no better place to start than in Ganaroum Bak.

Yet the memory continues back in time until it clears the city, and the rememberer finds himself traversing the undeveloped nature growing along the shores of the central oasis lake. He sees Gruumsh's spear standing tall at the lake's center with its adamantine tip glinting hundreds of feet above the desert. The spear remains untouched since it struck there more than a thousand years ago. Still tightly gripping the spear's shaft is the skeletal hand of Gruumsh. The clawed hand serves as the sultan's palace, whose family carved out spires and ballrooms within the strong bones.

Finally, he remembers the doorstep through which he set out on his adventure months ago and the strange events leading up to his departure. He remembers the tea he drank on the floor of his parent's home as his long-lost uncle told him his tale. And the look on his parent's faces as they realized that he would be leaving them.
