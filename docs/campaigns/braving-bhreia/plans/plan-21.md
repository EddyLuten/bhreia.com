## Approaching Battle

On the road

> Here in the heart of Korbantir, nestled between the mountain ranges in a deep valley, muddy rivers empty out in marshes and foggy wetlands. Dense oak forests give way to curled cypress, black ash, and sweatwood trees brimming with squaking birdlife. In this wind shielded valley, the air lingers densely with humidity, pollen, and seems to cling to your skin. All around you, waterlogged trees reach for the sun while frogs croak and insects scurry as you pass stagnant ponds that smell of earth and decay.

- More travel
- It begins to rain

> Ahead, a river overfed by the rain and overflowing its banks cuts through the marshes and has washed away part of the road. The rushing water makes it difficult to gauge how deep it is, but you can see the other side not 50 feet across. What do you do?

As they approach: BATTLE
