## On the Surface

Sebastian sees a group of [[au]] guards arrive, escorting what looks like a priest of Dhoutr wearing all-black robes and a black chain shirt.

They hail him but soon notice the corpse still on the field. When they go to check out Clank, he tells them to stand back. That's when the dragonfly bursts out of the memorial and grows in size, followed by Sah-Sauj.

The guards at the corpse look around and notice both SS and the dragonfly.

The priest will call out to either Sah or Seb about what's going on and approach cautiously.

**ON COMBAT:** they will recognize the group if they combat. One of them will immediately take a horse and ride off at high speed.

## Underground

Finish up [[korbans-memorial]].
