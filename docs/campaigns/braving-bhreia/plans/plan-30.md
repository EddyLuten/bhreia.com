# 🔐 Plan: Session 30

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

- [Recap](../sessions/session-29.md)
- New interview format: Sebastian
- Update: no more recordings, too much work
- Maybe every 2 weeks now to reduce prep
- AU arrive
- Back underground
- Road squid

## On the Surface

Sebastian sees a group of [[au]] guards arrive, escorting what looks like a priest of Dhoutr wearing all-black robes and a black chain shirt.

They hail him but soon notice the corpse still on the field. When they go to check out Clank, he tells them to stand back. That's when the dragonfly bursts out of the memorial and grows in size, followed by Sah-Sauj.

The guards at the corpse look around and notice both SS and the dragonfly.

The priest will call out to either Sah or Seb about what's going on and approach cautiously.

**ON COMBAT:** they will recognize the group if they combat. One of them will immediately take a horse and ride off at high speed.

## Underground

Finish up [[korbans-memorial]].

## Road Squid

They encounter a man named Theophilus (Theo) Picot, a fisherman from Korban's Landing whose cart has fallen over.

A **DC 10 Nature** check by Pasha will reveal that the smell coming from the cart is squid.

If they help Theo, they may see that this is only a small piece of squid tentacle -- a giant squid. It takes up the entire cart and is stapped down with thick ropes to prevent it from shifting.

A single person will require a **DC 19 Strength** check to upright the cart or a group check of **DC 17 Strength**.

Reward: He will give them a brass token, resembling a **Square Knot**. He tells them that they can use this at **The Salt Lick** (a tavern for sailors) for a free round of drinks. "Tell 'em Theo sent ye."

Theo is taking the squid arm to Leecham where there's a professor who might be able to tell more about the arm. The professor's name is Kenkar (an anagram for Kraken).

This arm was cut off by a crew trying to prevent whatever owned the arm from capsizing their ship.

Strange creatures have been seen in the seas as of late, tales of:

- Strange pale people walking into the ocean as if taking a stroll, wearing nothing but white nightgowns
- Distant songs echoing across the waves, their lyrics incomprehensible, yet beautiful and enticing, drawing you onto the open sea
- Fins the size of ships breaching the surface, clipping the sides of ships
- And worst of all: the corpses of sailors long since drowned washing up on shore. Theo found his best friend on the beach, his body perfectly preserved. He drowned more than a decade ago.

He says that there are plenty more stories being told. All these things have been happening since the dragon attack last year. Things have been getting bananas.
