  - This will start [[boonabell]], though this is best done later

- [[ixs-locker]]

## Ix's Locker

The password to [[ixs-locker]] is the name of [[ixs-mother]]'s favorite song.

She lives in the haunches, near the shipyard. There's a man (Walker) on her block who plays her the song on a daily basis. He doesn't know the name of the song, just the words and the music, he just calls it "Rala's Song," which is not the song's name.

Only Rala knows the name of the song.
