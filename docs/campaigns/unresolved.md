# 🔐 Unresolved Storylines

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Storylines that have been opened up, but not yet resolved.

## Ironstone Forge

Why did Phidippus buy the forge? Some ceremonial thing? Hot fires? How much would the Forge cost to buy back?

## Phidippus and Dauriel

Dauriel suspects that Phidippus may have influenced him somehow to invite him to the party. Is it true? And why does Phidippus want to be there? Will he show up?

## The Changed Tomb

On their second return, the tomb's alarm was triggered. The password was changed. Who did this and why? Phidippus?

## Macoyii Significance

The Macoyii captured for Phidippus by the Goblins are used for something. One of them was pregnant, both were tied up at some point. Why? Sacrifice in town?

## Marram

Marram is dangled in front of the group, though they will have to face the threat in Cauldin's Point first. How could they possibly help out with the genocide that's happening there? They have acquired a partial map of Marram.

## Gadot's Dad

Gadot's dad (Phillipe) is in Marram on Dauriel's orders. Once Dauriel is out of the picture, Phillipe will have no more contact. Does he become stranded?

## Dauriel and Cauldin's Artifacts

The gang gave Dauriel the artifacts they found (drawings + journal) and Dauriel would look into them, but hasn't as of yet.

## Wolf's Robbers

Wolf's robbers ([Captain Freeney](../adventures/dauriels-mansion/npcs/captain-freeney.md)) have not yet been confronted. They did sell his cigars in town to people, including [Maniac](../adventures/dauriels-mansion/npcs/maniac.md). Kolwyn, the stable boy, did mention that Freeney occasionally came to drink at the inn.


## Jonah's Demon Statue

Wolf saw the statue, and mentioned it to the others, but no action has yet been taken to try and figure out what it is. It's tucked in between some bottles in a cabinet behind Jonah's bar.

## Why is Rhea Tired?

Mentioned several times that Rhea is tired, but why? Cult business?
