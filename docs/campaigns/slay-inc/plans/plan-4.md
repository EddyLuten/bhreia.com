## The Arena

Once through the dungeon and out of the portal, they exit into the Arena:

> Light blinds you and the deafening roar of thousands of cheering voices pierces your ears as you exit the portal. When your eyes adjust to the light, you make out the massive crowd that has gathered in what seems to be an enormous arena. Tens of thousands. They are watching you, cheering for you.
>  
> Ahead, on a podium, you see the king and his two wives, applauding and cheering as you exit the portal. On your left, you see five groups of wounded warriors, applauding. When you look behind you, you see your own image projected in three dimension in mid-air, larger than life. Suddenly, a voice booms out, echoing against the walls of the arena:
>  
> "That's Slay, Inc., everybody! Our final group to join the sentinels has made it through the first stage!" The voice comes from the podium. And you see the man you've met before: the wizard Yil Romka. Atop his staff, the eye emits a beam of light, which seems to produce the massive projection behind you. "Let's take one last look at today's sentinels."
>  
> The projection changes and shows the groups on the arena floor fighting a variety of creatures, not unlike yourselves. One group on a mountain top, one in a burnt village, one wading through rivers. Wherever they are, it all ends with one group killing the other. Finally, it shows your group going through the darkness, fighting skeletons and the shadow demon. The crowd goes nuts. They love it.
>  
> While the projection is displayed, a group of healers approach you and begin bandaging your wounds. One of them, a black-haired female Gnome bandages your wounds [player], and says: "I bet you didn't know about all this, huh?"

Depending on their answer, she will invite them to find her in the hidden temple of Primani hidden underneath a Temple of Urlac in the eastermost outskirts of the city.

!!! info "Clue"
    She says, "look for a sign of life where all else is dead."

Once the projection completes, they are escorted to their locker rooms.

TODO

## The Hidden Temple

The temple of Urlac is locked, dilapidated. It is surrounded by a vast decrepit graveyard. Most tombstones are weathered away, but a few mausoleums remain standing.

!!! info "Clue Solution"
    Look for a sign of life where all else is dead.

    There are mausoleums with name plaques:

    - Ronil Vestim
    - Larra Romka
    - Beaton H. Art
    - P.M. Tyndo III

    "Beaton H. Art" is the solution: "Beating Heart"

A well-worn staircase descends into a tunnel, seemingly snaking back towards the old temple of Urlac. Lit torches lead the way to a thick wooden door. When knocked upon, a spy hole opens up and ask what they're doing here.

!!! info "Riddle"
    "Solve the riddle or get lost."

    You only get me once and I'm too easily lost.
    I'm taken for granted, but I can't be replaced.
    Some throw me away on purpose, yet some wish to have me forever.

    Answer: Life
