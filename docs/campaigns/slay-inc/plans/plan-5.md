# 🔐 Slay, Inc. Plan: Session 5

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

- [Recap Session 4](../sessions/session-4.md)
- [[psa]]

## Intrusion

A knock on the door. Tomund prompts the riddle, but looks back, and shakes his head at Gana while brandishing his weapon and donning his armor.

Gana asked if they were followed. Did they bring palace guards?

She's hidden this place for 100 years, she's angry and sad.

Loud banging on the door: they're breaking it down.

She gives them a way to escape via the hidden exit behind the bookcase.

Gana leads the way and burns her journals behind her.

Tomund stays behind.

## Fresh Air

Moment later, the clashing of blades rings from behind them. Screams. And not much later, it's quiet.

Smoke fills the tunnel and they must escape quickly or suffocate.

As they exit the tunnel, pushing aside an old tombstone, a portal appears the moment they surface.

Gana tells them to keep playing the games. She will find a way to communicate with them in the palace.


## Into the Portal

Once through the portal
