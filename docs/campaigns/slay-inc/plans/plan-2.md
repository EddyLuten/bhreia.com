# üîê Plan: Session 2

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

## Lyle Intro

A small vessel pulls into the harbor at the Arjuna seaport. Its white main sails are torn and one of its masts broken in two. Yet, Captain **Sywex Elkin**, a spry young half-elf easily docks the damaged ship.

Lyle, there's nothing on your mind but last night's storm. The the same one that took the life of your good friend and colleague, Braggish. You turned around for only a moment and he was gone. Chewed up whole by the blackest waves you've ever laid eyes on. No matter how much you yelled out, the sea did not return Braggish to you.

You're bumped out of your day dream by the bumping of the ship against the wooden dock.

"Looks like something went down here," Sywex says and points to the carcass of a Bulette lying on the docks, covered in blood. In beyond it, near a set of metal fences, you see the familiar outlines of your colleagues. They watch you and wave you over as you walk down the gangplank onto the dock.

Lyle, can you describe what they see?

## At the Palace

The coach arrives. It's white and inlaid with silver flowers and takes them directly to the palace.

- They see on their journey from the window
  - Several temples of [[urlac]]

When they get out.

!!! quote
    White stone holds up the massive palace at the heart of this city. Its spires curve upwards and terminate in gleaming silver tips. The palace guards open the massive oak doors and guide you inside.

Here, they go through the main entrance.

!!! quote
    The floors and walls are marble inlaid with streaks of silver and before you, the throne room becomes visible. On his throne, surrounded by his two wives sits **Gajarta of Sarapum**, 53rd of his name. He smiles as he sees you approach, but the guard takes a left turn and brings you into a small chamber.

    The guard points towards a row of chairs. "Please take a seat."

The guard leaves.

They are taken into a small room where a Human male in a red robe sits behind a desk, looking at paperwork.

His name is "**Yilus Romku**" and is the king's advisor. Leaning against the desk is his staff with a sphere containing an eye that follows you around on top.

!!! quote
    Welcome, welcome, **Ahtel**. Before you ask, that means *champion* in Silubrian. I hope your journey was easy enough?

They are called "Ahtel" (from: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%84#Pashto>), which means champion in Silubrian.

He takes some of their info and questions and takes them to their locker room.
