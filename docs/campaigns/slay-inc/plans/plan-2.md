# 🔐 Plan: Session 2

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

## Lyle Intro

A small vessel pulls into the harbor at the Arjuna seaport. Its white main sails are torn and one of its masts broken in two. Yet, Captain **Sywex Elkin**, a spry young half-elf easily docks the damaged ship.

Lyle, there's nothing on your mind but last night's storm. The the same one that took the life of your good friend and colleague, Braggish. You turned around for only a moment and he was gone. Chewed up whole by the blackest waves you've ever laid eyes on. No matter how much you yelled out, the sea did not return Braggish to you.

You're bumped out of your day dream by the bumping of the ship against the wooden dock.

"Looks like something went down here," Sywex says and points to the carcass of a Bulette lying on the docks, covered in blood. In beyond it, near a set of metal fences, you see the familiar outlines of your colleagues. They watch you and wave you over as you walk down the gangplank onto the dock.

Lyle, can you describe what they see?

## At the Palace

The coach arrives. It's white and inlaid with silver flowers and takes them directly to the palace.

- They see on their journey from the window
  - Several temples of [[urlac]]

When they get out.

!!! quote
    White stone holds up the massive palace at the heart of this city. Its spires curve upwards and terminate in gleaming silver tips. The palace guards open the massive oak doors and guide you inside.

Here, they go through the main entrance.

!!! quote
    The floors and walls are marble inlaid with streaks of silver and before you, the throne room becomes visible. On his throne, surrounded by his two wives sits **Gajarta of Sarapum**, 53rd of his name. Before you can take in much more of the scene, the guard takes a left turn and brings you into a small chamber.

    He points towards a row of chairs. "Please take a seat."

The guard leaves.

### Yil Romka

They are taken into a small room where a Human male in a red robe sits behind a desk, looking at paperwork.

His name is "**Yil Romka**" and is the king's advisor. Leaning against the desk is his staff with a sphere containing an eye that follows you around on top.

!!! quote
    Welcome, welcome, **Ahtel**. Before you ask, that means *champion* in Silubrian. I hope your journey was easy enough?

They are called "Ahtel" (from: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%84#Pashto>), which means champion in Silubrian.

He takes some of their info and questions and takes them to their locker room.

Tells them:

- When you're needed to fight for the realm, a portal will appear
- We will know when you're done and a portal will appear to return you here
- It's important to finish the fight or the portal will not appear
- For now, you will be restricted to your locker room
- Will be allowed entry into the city after you've proven yourself in combat
- "Thank you for defending Silubria, Ahtel!"

## The Arena

Once through the dungeon and out of the portal, they exit into the Arena:

> Light blinds you and the deafening roar of thousands of cheering voices pierces your ears as you exit the portal. When your eyes adjust to the light, you make out the massive crowd that has gathered in what seems to be an enormous arena. They are watching you and cheering for you.
>  
> Before you, on a podium, you see the king and his two wives, applauding and cheering as you exit the portal. On your left, you see five groups of wounded warriors, applauding. When you look behind you, you see your own image projected in three dimension in mid-air, larger than life. Suddenly, a voice booms out, echoing against the walls of the arena:
>  
> "That's Slay, Inc., everybody! Our final group to join the sentinels has made it through the first stage!" The voice comes from the podium. And you see the man you've met before: the wizard Yil Romka. Atop his staff, they eye emits a beam of light, which seems to produce the massive projection behind you. "Let's take one last look at today's sentinels."
>  
> The projection changes and shows the groups on the arena floor fighting a variety of creatures, not unlike yourselves. One group on a mountain top, on in a burnt village, one wading through rivers. Wherever they are, it all ends with one group killing the other. Finally, it shows your group going through the darkness, fighting skeletons and the shadow demon. The crowd goes nuts. They love it.
>  
> While the projection is displayed, a group of healers approach you and begin bandaging your wounds. One of them, a black-haired female Gnome bandages your wounds [player], and says: "I bet you didn't know about his, huh?"

Depending on their answer, she will invite them to find her in the hidden temple of Primani hidden underneath a Temple of Urlac in the city.

Once the projection completes, they are escorted to their locker rooms.
