## Braggish Intro

Braggish underwater music.

> Braggish, you remember going overboard as your ship was tossed around on the sea like a child's toy. Now cold waves embrace you when enter the deep, striking your nerves like a thousand frozen needles. As you sink into the depths, the raging storm and moonlight above fade into nothingness. And you are alone. Sinking. Growing colder. You wonder how you lost your sealegs. It all happened so fast. But now your soul dims and your limbs seize like frozen machinery in the icy abyss.
>
> But there's something there with you. Something down there besides the flickering ember of your soul. Two pale spots of green watch you from the void. Whose eyes are they? You wonder when something grabs hold of your wrist, pulls you. Deeper. Colder. Curling and tightening around your wrist like slimy tendrils of something that shouldn't be alive. You fade until nothing remains.

Shore ambiance.

> The dream fades quickly, but it stays with you like a memory. Your eyes are closed, but you can sense where you are. Sunlight warms your back, waves lap at your feet, and you taste the salt of the coarse sand on which you lay. You're alive, somehow. Now, what do you do?

- See ruins nearby
  - White square houses, blue roofs
  - ruinous, doors missing, broken walls
  - **DC 12 Perception**
    - Old dried blood
    - Long scratches
    - most buildings have an eye-carving
  - **DC 15+** made by claws, large claws
  - One of the ruins, a windmill, contains a desecated corpse
    - Looks like a male Orc
    - Has Braggish's stuff
    - Decades years old
    - Wearing an iron snake bangle
    - When the items are removed:
      - From its chest cavity, tiny spiders attack
      - When they are damaged, its mother shows up

During this battle, Yil Romka shows up and kills the crabs.

He asks if he's Braggish, and swaps him with Reginald.

## The Arena

Once through the dungeon and out of the portal, they exit into the Arena:

> Light blinds you and the deafening roar of thousands of cheering voices pierces your ears as you exit the portal. When your eyes adjust to the light, you make out the massive crowd that has gathered in what seems to be an enormous arena. They are watching you and cheering for you.
>  
> Before you, on a podium, you see the king and his two wives, applauding and cheering as you exit the portal. On your left, you see five groups of wounded warriors, applauding. When you look behind you, you see your own image projected in three dimension in mid-air, larger than life. Suddenly, a voice booms out, echoing against the walls of the arena:
>  
> "That's Slay, Inc., everybody! Our final group to join the sentinels has made it through the first stage!" The voice comes from the podium. And you see the man you've met before: the wizard Yil Romka. Atop his staff, they eye emits a beam of light, which seems to produce the massive projection behind you. "Let's take one last look at today's sentinels."
>  
> The projection changes and shows the groups on the arena floor fighting a variety of creatures, not unlike yourselves. One group on a mountain top, one in a burnt village, one wading through rivers. Wherever they are, it all ends with one group killing the other. Finally, it shows your group going through the darkness, fighting skeletons and the shadow demon. The crowd goes nuts. They love it.
>  
> While the projection is displayed, a group of healers approach you and begin bandaging your wounds. One of them, a black-haired female Gnome bandages your wounds [player], and says: "I bet you didn't know about all this, huh?"

Depending on their answer, she will invite them to find her in the hidden temple of Primani hidden underneath a Temple of Urlac in the city.

Once the projection completes, they are escorted to their locker rooms.
