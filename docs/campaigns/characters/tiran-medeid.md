## Bio

(Pulled from Google Docs)

It's always been said that opposites attract. That's never more true when love is forbidden. The romantic story, between a highly intelligent wizard and a blacksmith, strong of arm and wit, is the tale that preceded Tiran Medeid. Tiran grew up caught between two worlds. Half of the family came from a long line of humans living in high towers filled with tomes and poured over knowledge with fierce hunger. The other half of his lineage found were far more comfortable in the sweltering heat of a blast furnace, hammer in hand crafting some of the finest weapons and armor of the realms.

His mother Sophia Ironstone had an eye for imperfections and created some of the sharpest and strongest blades. Many of the bravest and strongest fighters tried to win over her heart but legend had it that she her heart beat as strong as her hammer and the fires of she was around had tempered it harder than the steel she worked as such she worked the forge until past her prime and the layer of soot would be the only thing that covered her marriage finger.

That was until she met Malachi Medeid. A younger man, small of frame but large of heart and mind. Malachi who was raised in cloistered warehouses filled with bound pages of timeless wisdom began to dream of more. He read of great adventures and the people that had them. Those that forged great paths in history, turned the tides of battles and civilizations. Having an innate ability to comprehend magic he decided to make a life beyond the stone walls much to the chagrin of his parents. He traveled far and wide, studying under wizards of lands far away. As he became more adept he was approached by Dauriel Aldarion and his league of adventures at Aldarion Unlimited.

Of course Dauriel needed to outfit his company and so he sourced weapons and armor from the Ironstone smiths. Who, for nearly a century, never disappointed. While on a contract and adventuring party of which Malachi was a part needed to outfit and so they graced the doorway of the Ironstone smiths. This was the first time Malachi saw the imposing figure and fiery hair of Sophia and he was quite enamored. However, he assumed her tastes were for that of a similar build to her, until the advances of the warriors in the party were quenched as quickly as hot iron in the cool spring water. Over the next years he would find excuses to return, and Sophia would listen to tell of grand stories, of ancient fables, and to word of recent tales that would likely become myth and legends throughout the world. It was Malachi's knowledge, humility and wide eyed excitement of the world that eased the beating of Sophia's sledgehammer heart and stoked a much different fire inside.

One fateful evening, while snow was still on the ground and Sophia and Malachi sat in the shop, bodies warmed by the forge, hearts warmed by each other, the door to the shop burst open. The imposing figure encompassed the entire opening of the door so thoroughly that the wind could barely squeeze snowflakes in the space between him and the door jam. The father of Sophia, patriarch of the Ironstone family stepped in. He absolutely forbade the two of them to be together. He went on berating Sophia, that it would be better for her to spend decades alone than with someone who couldn’t swing a hammer. He ran Malachi out of the shop and threatened his life and reputation. If Malachi continued to see Sophia then Hanlar Ironstone would use his family's close relationship and influence with Dauriel and have Malachi ejected from AU.

Over the next months Sophia would sparsely receive letters from Malachi. Some days her forge would burn hot with anger at her father, other days her arm sluggish from the weight of love unfulfilled. Seasons came and went until finally, late one evening there was a rapping on the door. As Sophia opened it, exasperated as the nerve of whoever wanted to disturb a smith in the evening, with a defence ready of why they would need to return tomorrow. Standing on the ground, finally dry from the melting of the previous winter's snow, stood Malachi. He had earned enough coin to buy them a hamlet and enough reputation that he didn’t require AU. Sophia without hesitation, irons still in the fire, pulled off her apron, wiped the layer of ash and grime, now marred with tears of joy from her cheeks. She closed the door behind her and didn’t look back.

They built a home together near the town of Basford, far from the reach of the Ironstone family. It was the perfect amalgamation of their lives. A small wooden cottage near a lake, nestled between a stone tower which began to fill with books and knowledge flowed to any who would seek it and a large shop centered around a large kiln which was field with the ring of metal against metal and billowed clouds of smoke. Providing everything from weapons, and tools to the surrounding villages and anchors, rivets, and fasteners for the nearby seas.

It was in this environment that Tiran was raised. He learned of magic from his father, and craftsmanship from his mother. As a child his brain swirled with visions and dreams of marrying the two disciplines much as the story of his parents. Any time an adventurer came to visit whether it was to rekindle a friendship with his father or get gear from his mother, he wouldn’t let them leave without showing him their technique and spending time practicing with him in the training ground he had built out back. His desire to learn and excitement for the world matched his fathers, and his hands for crafting were strong and seasoned like his mothers. He loved his life but did dream of the world beyond his hamlet and the stories he heard only kindled the passion for adventure.

As Tiran entered neared adulthood, he desired to experiment more with the commixture of magic and metal though it was scene as near heresy for his mom and incomprehensible to his father, as only few books were ever penned by dwarven smiths on the matter and most of the weapons of renown he had encountered were typically blessed by some deity or another. If he truly wanted to master that craft he would have to find that knowledge someplace else. Two decades since the last time Sophia had heard from any of her kin, ostracised due to her choices, the Medeid family received a letter from an old acquaintance.  Aldurian penned a letter, fondly greeting Malachi and hoping to find him well and letting Sophia know that his business acquaintance, her father had passed and not one smith had been able to replicate the level of quality of the Ironstone family and if she so desired he would like to continue this partnership with her. Though, She was happy with her life and the surrounding settlements needed her here as much as she desired to stay.

As they talked over dinner Tiran expressed his interest in starting his own smithy, his own career, his own adventure. After talking for quite some time and knowing the head and heart of the lad they sent word back to Daurien that they would be sending the combined knowledge and experience of the Medeid family, along with a cache of abundance of goods to tide AU over until such a time as Tiran could get a smithy up and running.

Tiran and Sophia worked tirelessly for months. Crafting weapons and armor. Finally, Tiran climbed aboard a laden cart waved goodbye to his beaming parents and set wheels into motion towards Cauldin’s point and his destiny
