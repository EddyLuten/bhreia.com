# Lyrics to the Song

Sang on the first night by a Satyr in [Jonah's Denn](../../adventures/dauriels-mansion/places/jonahs-denn.md).

!!! cite
    The Age was young, but the evening grew long,  
    and the wayfarers warmed by the fire.  
    Though far from home, weary, and restless,  
    their hearts yearned for what they desired.

    Was their voyage foretold? Could the fates be this bold?  
    Or is chaos all that they see?  
    The time did seem right, though try as I might,  
    For this lot I found no prophecies.

    But the Age was young and the morning did call,  
    and the wayfarers warmed by the fire.  
    Their fortures called, and now fully rested,  
    set out to fulfill their desires.
