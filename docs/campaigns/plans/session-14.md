Ask for fun fact: Sah-Sauj

## Touch Points

- Sophia is feeling despondent after Agorius, she heads off to the river behind the house to remember her mother. Her husband is gone or missing, her mother and father are dead, her friend Philippe is missing, her son seems to be leaving again soon. She feels like Phidippus wanted this to happen to make her feel like this. She can be found stacking river rocks on the shore of the river where her mother committed suicide when she was a child.
