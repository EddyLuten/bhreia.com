## Amalchi's Messenger

Find an opportune moment, maybe toward the end of the session. A [[juvenile-dragon]] flies in from the east and crashes through the tree tops. This is **Dagaz**, one of [[amalchi]]'s five new children.

!!! cite "Flavor"
    For the briefest moment, you hear the sound of wings thrashing through the air before you see a large shape burst through the tree tops to your right. Before you stands a juvenile light blue dragon with a single glowing white eye in its head. It quickly scans its surroundings and with a snap of its neck, locks its gaze with Agorius, who stands frozen and watches in fear as the creature opens its mouth. It speaks to him in Draconic:

    **Draconic:** levethix chiilipen dout drinlekih tenpiswo vur ossalur haruhe. Wux claxir kiri drong vur opsola rigluinic dout whaisih.

    **Translated:** Wizard, conclude your business here and travel east. You are taking too long and Father needs your presence.

It will notice Pasha.

!!! cite "Flavor"
    When it concludes, it slowly turns its head and looks directly at Pasha. You feel its glowing eye and a strange, old, hostile familiarity. It once again opens it mouth to speak, but speaks only two words.

    **Draconic:** Isthasy neban.

    **Translated:** Traitor brother.

    You see through its gaping maw something beginning to glow in its throat, as it begins to fly directly toward you.

    Roll for initiative.
