# 🔐 Session 12

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

## Player Cues

- Tiran wants to build a raft to get the robot off the island
- The halfling that they assaulted will come back to haunt them

## Assaulted Halfling

!!! info "Burron Piquette"
    The plump male Halfling who Wolf assaulted is named **Burron Piquette**.

!!! info "Magistrate"
    The magistrate overseeing the camp's legal issues is named **The Honorable Fynnwick of Herrenfort**.

Halfling will have Weslan Stillwater with him and a few AU bruisers. Weslan seems disappointed when the Halfling points them out.

He will ask the group to come with him peacefully and they will go to court in front of the provincial magistrate who will hear the halfling's complaint.

The magistate has a permanent setup in a large tent near Weslan's tent. He's seated behind a large desk and surrounded by books and a strong looking Leonin guard wearing an [[au]] uniform.

The charges:

- Assault: The cigar extinguished upon the halfling's forehead
- Robbery: The giant goat
- Vandalism: The destruction of the halter and bridles

Weslan will go to bat for them, saying he knows Phillipe and Malachi, but Londrina won't and be a character witness against them.

Witnesses: TODO

They will need to be very convincing.

Sentences: TODO

## Amalchi's Messenger

Find an opportune moment, maybe toward the end of the session. A [[juvenile-dragon]] flies in from the east and crashes through the tree tops. This is **Dagaz**, one of [[amalchi]]'s five new children.

!!! cite "Flavor"
    For the briefest moment, you hear the sound of wings thrashing through the air before you see a large shape burst through the tree tops to your right. Before you stands a juvenile light blue dragon with a single glowing white eye in its head. It quickly scans its surroundings and with a snap of its neck, locks its gaze with Agorius, who stands frozen and watches in fear as the creature opens its mouth. It speaks to him in Draconic:

    **Draconic:** levethix chiilipen dout drinlekih tenpiswo vur ossalur haruhe. Wux claxir kiri drong vur opsola rigluinic dout whaisih.

    **Translated:** Wizard, conclude your business here and travel east. You are taking too long and Father needs your presence.

It will notice Pasha.

!!! cite "Flavor"
    When it concludes, it slowly turns its head and looks directly at Pasha. You feel its glowing eye and a strange, old, hostile familiarity. It once again opens it mouth to speak, but speaks only two words.

    **Draconic:** Isthasy neban.

    **Translated:** Traitor brother.

    You see through its gaping maw something beginning to glow in its throat, as it begins to fly directly toward you.

    Roll for initiative.

BATTLE

When it dies, the sky flickers between night and day for a moment, but the perpetual day continues. However, now visible in the sky is one of the moons, low on on the horizon.
