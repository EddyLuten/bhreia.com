## House on Fire

START A TIMER

Go into initiative for each of those who want to help.

The house is already ablaze, the ground floor is burning wildly. The top floor has just started to catch fire. Smoke rises from the roof and through cracks in the windows.

They can hear Sophia call out for help. A **DC 15 Perception** check reveals which floor the shout came from. An 18 or higher reveals that the window to Sophia's bedroom is slightly ajar.

The kitchen has collapsed, the back entrance is gone, rubble and burning wood block any entrance from that direction.

The front door is barred shut, but a **DC 18 Strength** check will open it.

### Inside

Once inside, Sophia stops calling for help.

A **DC 15 Dexterity** check or take 1d6 damage from a falling support beam and become trapped. Must make a **DC 12 Stength** check to become untrapped.

A **DC 15 Perception** check reveals a thin trail of blood on the stairs leading to the second floor.

A **DC 15 Constitution** check or take **1d6 Fire Damage** from smoke inhalation for each change from room to room.

Both the doors to the guest bedroom and the master bedroom are open.

Sophia is in the master bedroom, knocked out cold. She has a headwound and is barely breathing.
