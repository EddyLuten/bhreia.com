# 🔐 Plan: Session 14

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

**Ask for fun fact:** Sah-Sauj

Don't forget to mention that they got inspiration last time.

## Touch Points

- **Tiran** wants to search the island again, but Hurq and Mike will tell them that they found a red disk in a flat see-through box and sold it to a weird man in the woods near the survivors camp. This can kick off [[dr-malchi]].
- **[[sophia]]** is feeling despondent after Agorius' betrayal. She heads off to the river behind the house to remember her mother. Her husband is gone or missing, her mother and father are dead, her friend Philippe is missing, her son seems to be leaving again soon. She feels like Phidippus wanted this to happen to make her feel like this. She can be found stacking river rocks on the shore of the river where her mother committed suicide when she was a child.
- The clocks, more specifically the crystals, are focuses for [[amalchi]] to merge the material and elemental plane of air. See [[clock-crystal]].
- **Wolf** still wants to bail depending on the outcome of the current plan. If Wolf doesn't go the trial, he will be wanted by the state and considered an outlaw.
- The next day will be the day when the trial of [[assaulted-halfling]] is supposed to take place!
