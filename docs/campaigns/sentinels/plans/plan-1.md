# 🔐 Plan: Session 1

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

!!! quote
    After a rough week at sea, the loud call of "Land Ho!" wakes you early in the morning. As you climb onto the deck above, you see the sun rise over the horizon, and beyond, a dark speck upon the water. Land.

    Behind you, Captain Codrick "The Cod" Benze of the cargo ship **The Bitter Pill** closes the door to his private cabin. The sea wind smooths his graying Cuniko fur and exposes a wide toothy grin.

    "Aaah," he says, "didn't I tell ye I'd get ye there?"

    His crew cheers loudly and begin their preparation for landfall. You look around and see your compatriots standing on the deck with you.

    After a final hour of sailing, the dark speck on the horizon has grown into a mountain. On its summit, between the clouds you can see the faint outlines of a city. And as the wind blows a cloud in front of it, it's gone again.

    But nestled within the foothills and much more prominent lies the capital city of **Sarapum**, glowing in the new sunlight. The polished silver roofs of the palace's many towers glint brightly; a beacon to any traveler on the high seas. Behind the palace, a hulking round structure protrudes from the mountain's rock face, you're not quite sure what it is, but it dwarves the palace below it. Never before have you seen a city so magnificent and awe inspiring.

    But, that's not where you're going.

    Miles below the capital, you see your destination. And as you approach, the many docks at the port city of **Arjuna** come into focus. The only place in Silubria open to foreigners. That is, foreigners without an invitation.

    "We're docking at the cargo port," The Cod bellows out. "Should be fine for travelers too... Probably."

    Alongside you, a larger ship moves in the same direction and quickly overtakes The Bitter Pill. Tied to the decks with metal chains are a variety of wooden crates. The chains rattle as the ship bounces on the waves. On its stern, the ship flies the royal banner of Silubria and docks minutes before you do.

    As The Bitter Pill pulls into dock, workers are already busy unloading the other ship with wooden cranes.

    "We're here," The Cod exclaims, and as the ship is moored, he is the first to walk down the gangway onto the wooden docks. "Get out yer paperwork. These Silubrians don't fuck around."

    White stone holds up the massive palace at the heart of this city. Its spires curve upwards and terminate in gleaming silver tips. The palace guards open the massive oak doors and guide you inside.

Here, they go through the main entrance.

!!! quote
    The floors and walls are marble inlaid with streaks of silver and before you, the throne room becomes visible. On his throne, surrounded by his two wives sits **Gajarta of Sarapum**, 53rd of his name. He smiles as he sees you approach, but the guard takes a left turn and brings you into a small chamber.

    The guard points towards a row of chairs. "Please take a seat."

The guard leaves.

They are taken into a small room where a Human male in a red robe sits behind a desk, looking at paperwork.

His name is "**Yilus Romku**" and is the advisor of the king. Leaning against the desk is his staff that has a sphere with an eye that follows you around on top.

!!! quote
    Welcome, welcome, **Ahtel**. Before you ask, that means *champion* in Silubrian. I hope your journey was easy enough?

They are called "Ahtel" (from: <https://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/%D8%A7%D8%AA%D9%84#Pashto>), which means champion in Silubrian.

He takes some of their info and questions and takes them to their locker room.
