A common misconception is that Skitterbugs fly while they bite and lacerate the skin, this however, is wrong. Skitterbugs leap from location to location with extreme agility and speed and use their wings to accelerate and guide their motion. In fact, Skitterbugs cannot fly, contrary to popular belief. The Skitterbug gathers flesh by making tiny lacerations in the skin of its prey, shaving strips of it with its razor sharp mandibles as it passes by. Once a Skitterbug has gathered enough flesh in its expandable thorax, it will retain some of it for nourishment, but bring most of it to its queen by regurgitating the semi-digested substance into her mouth.

The queen variant of this creature is slightly larger but much more hardy. It also has the unique ability to projectile vomit an acidic discharge from its mouth.

    **Daytime Hunters.** Skitterbugs only hunt during the daytime since they require light to see their targets.

    **Tree Dwellers.** Skitterbugs have evolved to blend into the bark of common trees and can be extremely difficult to see. Their leap will usually take them on a straight line from tree, to target, then to the opposite tree.

    **Piercing Shriek.** If the Skitterbug feels sufficiently threatened, it will emit a high piercing shriek to attract its peers and queen for help. While it's easy enough to kill a single Skitterbug, killing a swarm of them may be difficult.

    **Foul Odor.** If a Skitterbug has gathered a sufficient quantity of flesh, it may begin to emit a rotting odor until it can purge its payload into the mandibles of its queen.
