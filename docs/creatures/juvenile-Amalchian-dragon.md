# 🔐 Juvenile Amalchian Dragon

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

A juvenile dragon, child of [[amalchi]]. In terms of traditional D&D dragon stages, the juvenile sits between a Young dragon and a Wyrmling, representing a stage of growth in between. The creature is large, like a Young dragon, but paired down to represent less of a challenge. These should only be encountered at the start of [[blue-skies]].
