Based on coyotes and Native American trickster-coyote mythology. The name is a mix of "ma'ii" and "coyote".

Fond of stalking settlements, the macoyii are doglike creatures that use their voices to mimic humanoid distress calls to attract weak single targets, usually children. They stalk out their prey for extended periods of time while they learn the vocal sounds that attract them. Once the opportunity presents itself, the packs of 4-8 individuals hide in ambush while the alpha-leader of the pack makes the highly skilled mimicing vocal calls. The pack attacks as a single unit once the target is in place, tearing it to pieces.

These creatures are commonly found throughout the world, considered dangerous pests, and are often hunted for sport.
