## Ideas

They're in a gameshow. Foreigners are expected to go through a system of brackets until one group is left.

They aren't made aware of this until AFTER the first battle when they emerge in a giant arena with 15,000 people cheering.

The king and his two wives will be introduced to them by the king's wizard and advisor. His spell focus is a staff with an eye in it, through which he can broadcast the game in the arena.

The wizard is an agent of [[urlac]], and the eye visible in the wand is that of Urlac.

The wizard opens and closes portals to locations where the party is needed to act. Once the deeds are complete, the portal appears again.

## Q&A

- The royal family has been running a battle royale for generations
- Why?
  - It's to appease the god [[urlac]]
- Why does Urlac need appeasing?
  - The entire world is at war except for [[silubria]]. Urlac wanted to expand his war there, but the royal family struck a deal with him. The games are a way of sacrificing endless people to the god.
