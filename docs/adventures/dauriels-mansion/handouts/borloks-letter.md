# 🔐 Borlok's Letter

Held in [[borlok]]'s inventory.

Folded and crumpled so many times that the ink has faded and the paper has turned soft.

    My beloved Borlok. I hope you and our darling baby Hurq arrived safely in Rivoni Springs. If you have been writing me, I have not yet received word and I pray for your safety. Please hurry back home soon with the healing water, my illness is worsening. Your father is less willing than you to look after a human of poor constitution. Tell Hurq I love him. - Riva
