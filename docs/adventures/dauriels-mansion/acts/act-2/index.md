**Synopsis:** The adventurers go to Dauriel's birthday party, and witness Moreus being consumed by green energy and carried away into a subterranean complex.

## Optional: The Night Before

On the night before the party, if the party are awake, they can see the five moons of Bhreia lining up at midnight. Unbeknownst to them, this is the marker for the new [[timeline|Age]] to begin.

## Moreus' Speech

!!! quote "Moreus' Speech"
    Darling, thank you from the bottom of my heart for always being by my side, to love, support, and encourage me in my many foolish endeavors. Thank you for building a home with me, so filled with joy and love. And though you always say that our bond is that of equals, I feel indebted to you since you sacrificed so much of what you love to do in order to spend your life with me.

The crowd awws.

!!! quote "Moreus' Speech"
    I've always wished that there was a way to return all of that time to you but never knew how. I'm not as clever as you are, but it turns out that the solution was right in front of me all along, right here in our home.

Dauriel looks confused.

!!! quote "Moreus' Speech"
    I dreamed that I was trapped in a tight confined space, blue light all around me, and I couldn't move at all. And while I first thought that this was just a nightmare, I could hear you talk in the background. I realized that you were talking to me. And then I remembered that it was the conversation we had yesterday in your office. So, I went snooping around and found it.

Dauriel looks concerned.

!!! quote "Moreus' Speech"
    It speaks to me, darling. When I touched it, I knew that this would be the greatest gift that I could possibly give you. You could go adventuring again, see the world, help people. And I could help you, come with you, and you wouldn't have to worry about me. I'd be strong enough.

**Dauriel:** Moreus, what did you do?

!!! quote "Moreus' Speech"
    It speaks to me, darling. It told me to do *this*.

Moreus holds out a blue glowing sphere and crushes it in his hands.

Cue audio effect.

Dauriel screams out as Moreus is enveloped in tendrils of light blue energy. Swirling, whipping wildly around him. One of them slashes Dauriel in his chest, sending him barreling to the floor. Dauriel is unconscious.

The guests scatter and leave as fast as they can.

Moreus' eyes turn light blue, he falls backwards, but hovers above the floor and begins floating down the room towards the door.

He glides THROUGH the door, down the hallway, through the door to the basement and eventually through a locked and barred round double door.

## Basement

Moreus can be seen floating into the wine cellar, and finally through a set of circular double doors, locked by a mechanism.

This is a musical puzzle. The adventurers must enter the missing note, which ends up being the tonic. The puzzle unlocks the doors.

Once past this puzzle, they can go down a tunnel and end up at a collapsed tunnel. To the right is a pool of water, through which they can swim to end up in [The Complex](../act-3/index.md).
