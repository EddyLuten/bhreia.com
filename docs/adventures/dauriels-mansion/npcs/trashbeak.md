    ## The Hoard

    Trashbeak takes the trash put out on the streets in his pull cart and brings it to his enormous trash pit, which is his horde. He's extremely protective of this and does not like anyone entering or messing with his collection of trash.

    The group must make a **DC 14 Stealth** check to prevent getting spotted by Trashbeak.

    The pit is located in the ancient forest southwest of town and with some extensive searching, some interesting items can be found there (**Investigation Check** DCs listed below):

    * (15) A **Bag of Holding** filled with human bones hidden under a rock mixed in with the trash:
      * The bones belong to the blood sacrifices made by the [Cult of Amalchi](../organizations/cult-of-amalchi.md)
      * The bones are a variety of old and new bones
    * (13) A **Pole of Collapsing** (Witchlight pg. 212)
    * (10) An **Orb of Direction** (Witchlight pg. 212)
    * (12) A vial of [**Lesser Grungine**](../../../items/grungine.md)
    * (7) A **Rusted Shortsword** same stats as a regular shortsword, but must make a DC 15 Dexterity Saving throw after each use to prevent it from disintegrating.
