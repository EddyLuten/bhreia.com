    ## Biography

    *See also: [Amalchi](../../../deities/amalchi.md).*

    Born in 3009, Moreus was a worshipper in the Cult of Amalchi and chosen to become the vessel in which the deity could gestate and take a corporeal form. In 3044, this happened in the catacombs beneath [Cauldin's Point](../../../geography/settlements/cauldins-point.md) and Moreus' identity was erased and replaced with that of Amalchi.

    See [Act 1: Dauriel vs Amalchi](../acts/act-1/dauriel-vs-amalchi.md) for the continuation.

??? danger "DM: Stats"
    Moreus is a *Commoner*, he doesn't carry weapons.
