## Appearance

* Spindly thin with long limbs
* A thick beard, not very well maintained
* Dull blue eyes
* Bald head

??? danger "DM: Supplemental Facts"
    Due to their inability to conceive, he will be the last owner of Jonah's Denn, which might be just as well since the place has fallen into disrepair under his management.

    ## Demonic Inheritance

    Junior has inherited [the demon statue from his father](jonahs-demon.md), although in this case, the demon hasn't taken over Junior's life. Instead, it waited for Junior to get married to Rhea Feldspar and possessed her instead. [Read her entry](rhea-feldspar.md) for horrible details...

??? danger "DM: Stats"
    Junior is a *Commoner*, his club is named "Junior Jr."
