A demonic spirit inhabiting a small onyx statue in Jonah's Denn. It is the spirit of [[dhoutr]] who communicates with whoever is the owner of the statue of the time in a clandestine attempt to influence the world. It goal is to help its father/creator, [[amalchi]] reincarnate into the world and is the cause of the existence of [[amalchi-cult]].

## Appearance

The statue is a small bust of a creature with nubby horns on its head, its race is not known. What is also unknown is whom this likeness was modeled after.

It is placed on a wooden plinth, which seems to be a recent addition. A **DC 10 Investigation** check reveals the [[amalchi|five-pointed star of Amalchi]] inscribed on the bottom of the plinth.

TODO: expound and check into "Succubus" (maybe? or homebrew) in the Monster Manual.

## History

On the eve of the Second Age when Dhoutr was born, he took his time to enter Bhreia and inspected the world. He left behind a few items which would focus his spirit in the world when discovered (or when fate required it). These items would take on a familiar shape to the first person who encountered it. In the case of this bust, it took on the shape of Jonah Feldspar's younger brother's face, though with the addition of stubby little horns.
