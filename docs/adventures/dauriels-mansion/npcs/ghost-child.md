**NPC From:** [Ghosts Eat Ghosts](../sidequests/ghosts-eat-ghosts.md)

The ghostly appearance of a little girl, maybe ten years old or so. She haunts Jonah's Denn in an attempt to stay safe from the [Ghost Eater](ghost-eater.md) who hunts her and weak spirits like her.

Her spirit and memory are slowly fading from existence and she can't even remember her own name.

She will ask a player for help (one who can see ghosts or has magical abilities) the first night they stay - and provided no other side quest is active - at Jonah's Denn. The Ghost Eater is nearby and has figured out that she's staying there.

She and her mother were killed by the [Cult of Amalchi in their ritual](../organizations/cult-of-amalchi.md).

**Stats:** [See Lesser Ghost](../../../creatures/lesser-ghost.md)
