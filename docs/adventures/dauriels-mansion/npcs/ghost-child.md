**NPC From:** [[ghosts-eat]]

The ghostly appearance of a little girl, maybe ten years old or so. She haunts Jonah's Denn in an attempt to stay safe from the [[ghost-eater]] who hunts her and weak spirits like her.

Her spirit and memory are slowly fading from existence and she can't even remember her own name.

She will ask a player for help (one who can see ghosts or has magical abilities) the first night they stay - and provided no other side quest is active - at Jonah's Denn. The Ghost Eater is nearby and has figured out that she's staying there.

She and her mother were killed by the [[amalchi-cult|Cult of Amalchi in their ritual]].

**Stats:** See [[lesser-ghost]]
