# 🔐 Phidippus, the Wizard

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

## During "Dauriel's Mansion"

Name comes from [Phidippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phidippus), the genus of jumping spiders.

He's a wizard who lives in a tower east of [[cauldins-point]], deep in the wilderness.

He has a real gripe against the Ironstone family and has caused Hanlar's death. He knew Hanlar as a young man. They were amicable, friendly, for the longest time, but one day at [[jonahs-denn]], they got into a fight about steel vs sworcery and Hanlar humiliated him in front of all of Cauldin's Point. He retreated to a tower he built in the woods and only visited town to sacrifice in the [[amalchi-cult]]. Besides raising [[amalchi]], he wants to see the Ironstone family name extinguished. All of it.

He's an old acquaintance of [[dauriel]], going back decades. He was also [invited](../handouts/dauriels-invitation.md) to Dauriel's party, but his invitation was stolen. He's heard of the party and is quite peeved that he wasn't invited.

He owns an abandoned forge north of Cauldin's Point that originally belonged to the Ironstone family, the [[ironstone-forge]]. When **Hanlar Ironstone** died without an heir, the business stopped and its assets were sold off by the state to the highest bidder. For the forge itself, it was Phidippus, who hasn't done anything with the place yet.

He often bosses the goblins who [live nearby](../places/au-original-hq.md) to do dangerous tasks for little pay. He hasn't used violence against them, but he implies that he will use magic against them if they don't do his bidding. Currently, he has asked them to catch a [[macoyii]], which is tied up behind the cabin. He wants to have one so he can investigate how they can mimic any sound. He has given them a potion that will put the creature to sleep, but hasn't instructed them on how to administer it.

Phidippus uses the Macoyii during a sacrifice ritual in order to raise [[amalchi]]. He's a member of the [[amalchi-cult]] and becomes the main antagonist at the end of the adventure.

## During "Blue Skies"

TODO, expound.

- Amalchi has split from him, and left him severely scarred. Mentally, as well as physically. He's covered in obsidian.
- He's resentful, but still worships him
- He's given up the [[ironstone-forge]] and since he's presumed dead, the Medeids have bought it back
- He's pretending to be someone else and works at the forge to create time keeping devices
- He's getting *real* close to Sophia now that everyone else close to her is gone
- He's using the name [Agorius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agorius) now.

## Personality

He's pretty much Aristotle, though less wise, and will argue everything. He's also very petty and takes everything personally.
