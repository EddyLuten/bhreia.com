## During "Dauriel's Mansion"

Name comes from [Phidippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phidippus), the genus of jumping spiders.

He's a wizard who lives in a tower east of [[cauldins-point]], deep in the wilderness.

See [[hanlar-phidippus]] for details.

He has a real gripe against the Ironstone family and has caused [[hanlar]]'s death. One day at [[jonahs-denn]], they got into a fight about steel vs sworcery and Hanlar humiliated him in front of all of Cauldin's Point by cutting off his robes. He retreated to his tower in the woods and only visited town to sacrifice in the [[amalchi-cult]]. Besides raising [[amalchi]], he wants to see the Ironstone family name extinguished. All of it.

He's an old acquaintance of [[dauriel]], going back decades. He was also [invited](../handouts/dauriels-invitation.md) to Dauriel's party, but his invitation was stolen. He's heard of the party and is quite peeved that he wasn't invited.

He owns an abandoned forge north of Cauldin's Point that originally belonged to the Ironstone family, the [[ironstone-forge]]. After he killed the heirless [[hanlar]], the business stopped and its assets were sold off by the state to the highest bidder. Here, Phidippus has constructed the glass tubes and machinations necessary to feed blood to Moreus from a collection system.

He often bosses the goblins who [live nearby](../places/au-original-hq.md) to do dangerous tasks for little pay. He hasn't used violence against them, but he implies that he will use magic against them if they don't do his bidding. Currently, he has asked them to catch a [[macoyii]], which is tied up behind the cabin. He wants to have one so he can investigate how they can mimic any sound. He has given them a potion that will put the creature to sleep, but hasn't instructed them on how to administer it.

Phidippus uses the Macoyii during a sacrifice ritual in order to raise [[amalchi]]. He's a member of the [[amalchi-cult]] and becomes the main antagonist at the end of the adventure.

Amalchi has split from him, and left him severely scarred. Mentally, as well as physically. He's covered in obsidian. Phidippus feels abandoned by his deity and has lost contact. Though he's resentful, he still worships him, especially now that he's seen Amalchi's power firsthand.

He's given up the [[ironstone-forge]] since he's done with it, and since he's presumed dead, the Medeids have bought it back. However, he's pretending to be someone else (named [Agorius](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Agorius)) and works at the forge to create time keeping devices with [[sophia]].

He's using [Disguise Self](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Disguise%20Self) to change his face. He's never around for more than an hour since that's how long the spell lasts. He will burn up his spell slots trying to maintain his disguise.

He's getting *real* close to Sophia now that everyone else close to her is gone or has left. Sophia is feeling lonely, and Phidippus being the Ironstone hating man that he is, is taking advantage of this.

## Personality

He's pretty much Aristotle, though less wise, and will argue everything. He's also very petty and takes everything personally.
