# 🔐 Phidippus, the Wizard

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

## Rough Outline

Name comes from [Phidippus](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phidippus), the genus of jumping spiders.

He's a wizard who lives in a tower east of [Cauldin's Point](../places/cauldins-point.md), deep in the wilderness.

He's an old acquaintance of [Dauriel](dauriel-aldarion.md), going back decades. He was also [invited](../handouts/dauriels-invitation.md) to Dauriel's party, but his invitation was stolen. He's heard of the party and is quite peeved that he wasn't invited.

He owns an abandoned smithy north of Cauldin's Point that originally belonged to the Ironstone family. When **Hanlar Ironstone** died without an heir, the business stopped and its assets were sold off by the state to the highest bidder. For the smithy itself, it was Phidippus, who hasn't done anything with the place yet.

He often bosses the goblins who [live nearby](../places/au-original-hq.md) to do dangerous tasks for little pay. He hasn't used violence against them, but he implies that he will use magic against them if they don't do his bidding. Currently, he has asked them to catch a  [macoyii](../../../creatures/macoyii.md), which is tied up behind the cabin. He wants to have one so he can investigate how they can mimic any sound. He has given them a potion that will put the creature to sleep, but hasn't instructed them on how to administer it.

## Personality

He's pretty much Aristotle, though less wise, and will argue everything.
