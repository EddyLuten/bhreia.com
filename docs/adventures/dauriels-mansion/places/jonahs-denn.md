An Inn in [[cauldins-point]]. Run by:

- [[junior]]
- [[rhea-feldspar]]

Kick off point for the adventure. This is where the [[dauriels-invitation|invitation]] tells the adventurers to meet up.

??? danger "DM: Overview"
    Originally named "Jonah's Demon Inn," Jonah's Denn received its current name when part of the sign fell off and people assumed that the M were two Ns with strange kerning.

    Opened by Jonah Feldspar in 3021, the inn has been a staple location for travelers in the region. It is still run by Jonah's son, [[junior]].

??? summary "DM: Flavor Text"
    If you believed that the broken wooden sign precariously dangling above the door was a chance event, the interior of Jonah's Denn should cure you of such misgivings. As soon as you open the door, the sour aroma produced by generations of spilled ale soaked into the wooden floor announces its presence. You can almost *taste* the air in here; thick with stale belches, unwashed hair, and pipe smoke.

    **Daytime:** Though it well into the day, a few of last night's barflies still linger, either passed out or in the process of doing so.

    **Nighttime**: A few barflies are getting their soak for the night, and seem to be keeping mostly to their thoughts and nursing their drinks.

    From behind the bar, a spindly bearded man wearing a stained apron eyes you cautiously as you enter the establishment.

??? danger "DM: History"
    Jonah Feldspar (b. 2987 - d. 3068, age 81) was a geologist collecting mineral samples at the Kleftmon mountains. While digging, he stumbled upon a [[jonahs-demon|strange onyx statue]] and brought it with him on his way home to [[korbans-landing]]. However, as he set up his tent in the woods outside of the town of Cauldin's Point, the statue spoke to him in his dreams and told him to build an inn right where he lay.

    He did as he was told and opened the inn in 3021 and never went back home to [[korbans-landing]]. Though he never knew it, the demon ordered him to build the inn atop the lost tomb of Cauldin of Leikon, capped by a large round stone, part of which is visible in the basement. Jonah hired people to run his inn and spent his days in his office upstairs talking to the statue and writing down the transcripts. If asked what he was doing, he answered "that's between me and my demon." Thus, soon, the place became known as Jonah's Demon Inn. When he passed away in his old age, the onyx statue made its way downstairs and currently sits on a shelf behind the bar, nestled between some bottles. However, Jonah's writings have never been found.

    He did find time to procreate and find a wife, though there are some who argue that his demon ordered him to do so. His son, [[junior]], was born in 3028 and took over the business when he was old enough.
