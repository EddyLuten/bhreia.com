    * Larry Pert

#### Conservatory

Location: entire southern wall.

Used to germinate seeds and overwinter existing plants, also serves as a sun room for drinking tea and entertaining guests. The room is slightly lower than the rest of the house by about two feet and feels like an addition.

  * If the players look in it, they see the ghost of a woman tidy their clothes and fix up their appearance. Though the ghost is not visible in the room, the effects of her behavior are real and they can feel her. The ghost is bound to the mirror. Not saying "thank you" will cause the ghost to scratch the player with her fingernails for 1 point of slashing damage.
