# 🔐 Ghosts Eat Ghosts

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

AKA: Kids See Ghosts :ghost:

On their first night in [Cauldin's Point](../../../geography/settlements/cauldins-point.md), one of the party members experiences the [ghostly apparition of a child](../npcs/ghost-child.md) visiting them at night in [Jonah's Denn](../places/jonahs-denn.md). They tell the party member to keep quiet because the eater is hunting them.

* The child was killed in a sacrifice
* The child doesn't know why, but it was sacrificed at [Cauldin's Tomb](../places/cauldins-tomb.md) by the [Cult of Amalchi](../organizations/cult-of-amalchi.md)
* The eater can't be killed in ghost form, but it can hurt players
* The eater can only be killed after it phases back into the material realm where it's weaker
* The weapon that the eater uses can be used to kill ghosts
* The child can be saved, but can die if they're not careful
