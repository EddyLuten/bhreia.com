# 🔐 Ghosts Eat Ghosts

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

AKA: Kids See Ghosts :ghost:

On their first night in [[cauldins-point]], one of the party members experiences the [[ghost-child|ghostly apparition of a child]] visiting them at night in [[jonahs-denn]]. They tell the party member to keep quiet because the eater is hunting them.

* The child was killed in a sacrifice
* The child doesn't know why, but it was sacrificed at [[cauldins-tomb]] by the [[amalchi-cult]]
* The eater can't be killed in ghost form, but it can hurt players
* The eater can only be killed after it phases back into the material realm where it's weaker
* The weapon that the eater uses can be used to kill ghosts
* The child can be saved, but can die if they're not careful
