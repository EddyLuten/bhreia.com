# Motivations

Who wants what in the larger picture?

## Primary NPCs

**[[amalchi]]** wants to combine the material plane and the elemental plane of air so he and Bhreia can rule it together. Why? He **wants an equal share** of the world rather than just the elemental plane of air.

**[[bhreia]]** knows about Amalchi's plans and wants to prevent the mass extinction this would cause, i.e., she **wants to keep the status quo intact**.

**[[phidippus]]**, an aging human, bargained with Amalchi to make his plans happen. He **wants eternal life and power** as an immortal demi-god in this new plane of existence.

### TODO

- [[dauriel]]
- [[phillipe]]
- [[malachi]]

## Secondary NPCs

**[[leca]]** is trying to escape her past and **wants a peaceful and quiet life** as a hunter.

**[[chickadee]]** is trying to get home to [[marram]], but she fell in love with [[callum]] on the way there in [[korbans-landing]]. She **wants to be with Callum**, but since he can't leave the country, this conflicts with her desire to go home.

**[[callum]]** is in love with [[chickadee]], and since he thinks that he has no shot at the throne in [[korbantir]], **he wants to leave with her**.

## Tertiary NPCs

[[anton]] wants to return to his own timeline and thinks he's stuck in a coma dream.

[[sophia]] wants to go home with her son and husband; she wants things to return to normal.

[[tom-wake]] wants [[pasha]] to rejoin his crew.
