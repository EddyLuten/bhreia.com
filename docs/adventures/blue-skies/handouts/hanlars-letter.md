# 🔐 Hanlar's Letter to Sophia

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Sophia,

If you are reading this letter, it means that you have found it at the bottom of the chest in my office and I must be dead. That, or I forgot to burn it, in which case, please stop reading now!

You finding this letter means that we never reconciled our differences and I want you to know that I have regretted it since the day that you left. My stubborn pride prevents me from saying any of this to you in person, and I am ashamed to admit that even writing this has taken me back to the bottom of several bottles in order to find the courage to put ink to paper. I know that I am a soft and flawed creature hiding underneath a hard veneer of cold iron.

And like bending cold iron, losing your mother broke me. I know it was my fault for pushing her. I also know that she couldn't possibly give me what I wanted. Yet, I pushed her anyway. The fates had a daughter planned for Ingrid and me, not a son as I wanted like the Hanlars before me. You should have been good enough. You are *more* than good enough. I should have recognized everything that you tried to do to please me after her death. You even followed directly in my footsteps and I took it as an insult to my manhood.

My actions have been unforgivable, and I do not ask you to do so. I will willingly spend an eternity being chewed between Dhoutr's teeth for the pain I caused. The irony is that after I lost my wife, my daughter, and my dignity, I did get what I always wanted.

I am ashamed to write this, but you need to know. You have a half brother. He doesn't know he's an Ironstone, and legally he isn't. He's a bastard, mothered by a prostitute in whose arms I cried myself to sleep for years. Yet, he's a good hard working boy and lives here in town. His name is Kolwyn and he works at the stables at Jonah's Denn. I leave it up to you if you want to meet him, but I see much of you reflected in him and it has comforted me in a way. At least, give him the bag of coins I left in this chest. At least, give him the pouch of coins I left in this chest. You don't owe me anything and if you don't want to do so, you're not obligated.

Dauriel has told me that you have a son named Tiran. I know I will never meet him, but if he's anything like you, he has to be a great kid.

Your father,

Hanlar.
