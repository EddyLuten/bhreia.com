As reported by *The Easterner*, 17th of Lareox, 3062:

    An altercation between two men at Jonah's Denn in Cauldin's Point has left one of them exposed. Literally.

    The night began quietly as usual in the sleepy town's inn. A local magicker named Phidippus was still quite sober when the intoxicated Hanlar Ironstone approached him, according to sources. The two men met and carried a civil conversation until the topic of magic vs. swordsmanship was broached.

    "You could feel the tension build up as they talked louder and louder," says Junior Feldspar, owner of the establishment. "Still, I didn't think too much of it. Hanlar's got a big mouth, he usually doesn't cause any kind of harm."

    Patrons say that Mr. Feldspar should have interfered, but that he was drinking from his own supply, and nodding off. Ironstone and Phidippus yelled louder and louder and got to pushing and shoving.

    "The magic guy glowed his hands blue and told the drunk fellow to stand back," says witness Gorben Pomnoi. "But then the drunk one pulled his shortsword."

    With a single quick slash of the sword, the intoxicated Ironstone cut off Phidippus' robes, which fell to the floor and revealed that the man was wearing nothing underneath.

    "And then," Pomnoi continued, "the naked one began crying and ran out the door." Ironstone is said to have laughed for an hour straight before passing out drunk. No charges have been filed against him, though he has been banned from the establishment. Phidippus could not be reached for comment.
