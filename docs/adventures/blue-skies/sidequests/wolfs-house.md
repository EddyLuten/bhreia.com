# 🔐 Wolf's House

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

During the year that [[wolf]] wasn't present in his home, a young woman named **Leca Zan** has taken up residence in Wolf's house.

## Leca Zan

Scout, MM pg. 349.

Leca is a 23-year-old female Tiefling. She has long curly black hair and is a hunter by trade. She has a knee-high blonde hunting dog named **Cricket.**

Leca is originally from Dorr where she grew up in high society. Wanting a different life, one closer to nature (and fewer Tieflings), she left on the first ship leaving the harbor and ended up in Korbantir three years ago and became a hunter. It's been tough for her to get used to living independently, but after finding Wolf's cabin, things got a bit easier.

However, while she was in Crabpot, she was down on her luck and had to resort to stealing food. While trying to take some crabs for her and Cricket to eat, the fisherman noticed and chased her down> He cornered her in a dead-end alley. She handed him the crab back, apologizing, but now he had his eyes on her. He forced himself onto her, subduing her until Cricket came from behind and bit the man's throat. He stumbled backward and collapsed onto the ground, blood spraying from his neck. Leca ran as fast as she could through a busy fish market, covered in the man's blood. Later, she learned that the man died there, and she's currently wanted for his murder. She isn't safe anywhere.

## Coming up on the Cabin

Not too far from the cabin, the adventurers hear a song played on a fiddle. It's poorly played and whoever is playing keeps trying to get it right.

As they approach the cabin, they can see fresh rabbit skins drying on a tanning rack and the smell of rabbit stew permeates the air.

Before they can approach the fiddler, Cricket, the dog, will come running towards the adventurers and jump happily, licking their hands and faces. Cricket will run back to Leca, who's sitting on a bench overlooking the vegetable garden, trying to play Wolf's fiddle.

## The Cabin

The cabin is constructed out of bulky pine logs and is mostly overgrown with mosses and grasses. It is so camouflaged that if you were to look from the road, you would never know it was even there. It's purpose-built for a single person and features a single living area with a loft used for sleeping above it, accessible by a wooden ladder.

A lean-to stands beside the building meant for drying tobacco leaves and a small earthen oven for baking.

Standing in front of the cabin, the fiddling is louder and they can hear Leca talk to Cricket, asking why she's so worked up. The garden is visible now, and looks maintained. New vegetables are growing and Wolf's tobacco plants are thriving.

## Meeting Leca

Leca is still trying to play the fiddle when they approach her. She's wearing green pants and a black tank top, her jacket tied around her waste.

She immediately stops when she sees them and tells them that she doesn't want any trouble.

She will offer to leave and take her stuff, but she doesn't want any trouble.

## Trouble

Unbeknownst to the adventurers, they have been distantly followed by [[au]] guards who are ensuring that they aren't causing any more trouble. They have stealthily followed them to Wolf's house where they now see the Leca, a wanted outlaw, and will attempt to intervene. They will attack if necessary.

There are three guards (Aldarion Unlimited Company men), and they will dispatch one of them if the situation gets hairy. This final one will head back to the survivors camp in Cauldin's Point and warn [[weslan]]. Depending on how they've interacted with Weslan, he may tell the magistrate, who will put out a warrant for all of them and set **Inquisitor Ryssha** after them with **Kirenka**. See [[assaulted-halfling]].

## Nate's Chat

> **Eddy:** Hey dude. So, within the next few sessions there will be a distinct possibility of the gang either going to Wolf's home or at least passing it. Do you have some high level details on what should at least be there? It doesn't have to be anything fancy, a list will suffice if you don't have much time, but anything helps.  
> **Nate:** So I imagine Wolf's "house" as a semi-permanent bushcraft shelter that has been upgraded over the years to be more permanent. Something close to a primitive log cabin. So it's small and kind of built into the area using the landscape to help disguise it. It would be somewhat deep into the forest as he wouldn't want it easy to find but it's been lived in for so long that it stands out as a man-made structure if one is close enough. Nearby would be his tobacco and vegetable garden that is fenced and gated to keep Ramona from eating it all. The area around the shelter would be well worn from Ramona's grazing and both of them moving about. Although I suppose now it is overgrown from time's passage. Here are some images that convey what I imagine in my head.  
> **Eddy:** Do you have some kind of inventory in mind? I remember you talked about taking fiddle during the first session or so  
> **Nate:** I imagine more loggy than not. So he would have had some basics for harvesting and planting tobacco and root veg. Probably ate a lot of rabbit stew lol. Yeah he left the fiddle back at his house. Most of his cooking gear he had with him and was left in the cart pre-dragon attack. But the bigger stuff would be at the cabin still. I imagine a basic stone hearth and perhaps an open air lean-to for drying the tobacco leaves and storing some stuff in crates and barrels.
