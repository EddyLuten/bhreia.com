# 🔐 Clue

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

[[callum]] is dead, floating face-down in the water between the dock and [[tom-wake]]'s ship in the harbor of [[korbans-landing]]. Whodunnit?

## Who?

The primary actors in this tragedy are:

- [[tom-wake]]
- [[chickadee]]
- [[callum]]
- [[phidippus]], also as Agorius

## Meet Up

The gang meets up with Tom Wake in The Salt Lick, the tavern serving sailors in the harbor of Korban's Landing. With him are Chickadee and Callum in civilian clothes.

!!! info
    The gang will immediately recognize Chickadee since they met her when she worked as [[dauriel]]'s maid.

Callum is Prince Callum of the Royal house of Korbantir, though he won't reveal this and goes in civilian attire. He's in love with Chickadee, and they want to start a life together.

!!! info
    Callum looks familiar to those living in [[korbantir]], and a **DC 15 History** will reveal that his face is on pieces of copper.

Chickadee is conflicted about their relationship: she is deeply in love with Callum and wants to be with him, but she also wants to go home to [[marram]].

They tell the gang that Tom Wake's ship will take them across the pond to Rivoni, where they will eventually travel to their final destination: Marram, Chickadee's home.

!!! danger "Important Clue"
    Sometime during the evening, a crewman will enter and ask Callum or Chickadee if they want their chest in their quarters or storage.

    Neither of them knows what he's talking about, so the crewman tells them it must be someone else's, that he'll put it in storage, and leaves.

During their conversation, Tom tells Pasha that he wants him to rejoin his crew. He's lost a good fisherman and sailor and regrets letting Pasha go. His catch hasn't been the same, and he's losing money, which is why he's taking on passengers on his vessel.

Tom tells them to meet at his ship, *The Beacon,* in the morning.

He will recommend [[madame-mollishers]] as an inn, which is a brothel. Jugascuzz will do, too, but it's a terrible nasty crime-ridden shithole.

> We'll discuss business in the morning. Tonight, we drink!

## Next Morning

As the gang approaches *The Beacon* docked in the harbor, they can see a group of people watching something in the water between the ship and the dock. It's the body of Callum, floating face down. He has a ragged hole in his torso, burnt on the edges. Someone also has removed his lower jaw.

Chickadee is nowhere in sight.

!!! info "Clue"
    A **DC 12 Investigation/Perception** skill check will show that something burned him at a very high temperature. A set of very sharp teeth removed his lower jaw.

    A roll of **10 or higher** will reveal an unused [[potion-of-false-death]] in his pocket.

    A roll of **15 or higher** will reveal that extreme lightning damage caused the wound, usually caused by magic. Very much like [[pasha]]'s lightning damage wounds. Jaws are sometimes removed from corpses to prevent speaking with the dead through magical means.

    A roll of **17 or higher** will reveal a small piece of paper in Callum's hand, though most of the ink has been washed away by the seawater. Still legible: "Me.. .e a. th. .eac.. to....t a..ne" - translated: "Meet me at the Beacon tonight alone"

Tom Wake is still asleep in his cabin; he got shitfaced and passed out.

!!! info "Interrogation"
    Tom did hear a splash and a scream but thought nothing of it since the harbor is a bustling place. Plus, he was too ~~drunk~~ tired to get up.

    He also recalls hearing a cat scratch somewhere down in the cargo hold, so he assumed that the cat might have been making noise.

    Tom runs a skeleton crew due to budget constraints, so nobody else was aboard that night.

    He will reveal that Chickadee is staying at Gigglemug's, an inn in the fancy part of town called Ashwood Heights.

Before they get much more out of him, a group of guards enter the captain's cabin and place Tom under arrest. The leader of this group says that they've got an eyewitness who claims to have seen Tom murder Callum.

As he gets dragged off, he pleads with them to clear his name.

## On the Beacon

On the ship, they can find the chest that was referenced by the crewman in a storage compartment. It is labeled with Callum and Chickadee's names.

!!! info "Clue"
    A **DC 17 Thieves' Tools** assisted check will open the chest. It appears entirely empty except for some scratch marks made towards a mechanism that can open the chest from the inside. A **DC 12 Investigation** check reveals that the scratches look hastily done and the mechanism looks like it is slightly scorched on the inside only. This was done by a small dragon, probably a hatchling.

## At Gigglemug's

They can find Chickadee at the inn, waiting in her room. She will tell them that Callum had some business at the docks with Tom and that he hasn't returned yet.

If they inform her of his death, a **DC 17 Insight** check will reveal that she is feigning her sadness. However, if they tell her the cause of his death, she will be sincere in her sorrow and tell them they must be wrong.

When pressed (**DC 15 Intimidation/Persuasion**), she will tell them that she and Callum went to a local magicker named **Colonus** to get a [[potion-of-false-death]].

!!! info "Clue"
    If asked about Colonus' appearance, she will describe Agorius to them. Colonus is Phidippus in disguise as Agorius, but he uses a different name here. Callum learned about Colonus somehow, but the details are vague to Chickadee.

!!! info "Reasoning"
    Chickadee and Callum's reasoning was that they wanted to fake his death so that they could have a fresh start since the royal family would never approve of their relationship. Callum would take the potion at the palace, be found dead, eventually entombed, and after a few days come back to life to leave with Chickadee.

They met with Colonus in a dumpy hut behind the Fish Market in The Old City district. She can take them there or give specific directions.

Before they leave, they can hear the heavy footsteps of a group of guards approaching the room. Eventually, they will knock and ask for Chickadee by name. They order her to open up or they will break down the door. The owner pleads with them to not break down the door, which is made of solid [[ashwood]] (very pricey).

They can use the window to escape or fight the guards.

## Colonus' Hideout

When the gang arrives at the purported hideout, it's no longer there, and the spot seems deserted. A homeless Half-Orc female sleeps against a nearby wall, cradling an empty bottle. While the hut is gone, they do find:

!!! info "Clue"
    After an **Investigation** skill-check:

    - DC 10+: 
      - The symbol of [[amalchi]] drawn into the dirt where the hut stood
    - DC 12+: Many little footsteps in the dirt, resembling dragon feet
    - DC 15+: In a pile of junk, two discarded dragon egg shells, recently hatched

### The Half-Orc

Name: Vana

The gang can wake the Half-Orc female, who will give them more information if they get her some *good* liquor. She won't reveal much in exchange for lousy liquor. If she withholds information, Chickadee (if present) will get aggressive and physical.

!!! info "Clue: Bad Liquor"
    She saw the hut disappear, and Phidippus vanished with it along with his blue lizard pets. She knows more, but says, "come back when you have the good stuff."

    If present, Chickadee will get angry, shout at her, and get physical.

!!! info "Clue: Good Liquor"
    She saw Phidippus move his hands around strangely, and the hut disappeared. She will also remember that Phidippus had two big blue lizard pets he carried on his shoulder before disappearing.

    She also remembers him talking to a priest dressed in black robes a few days before.

    If they haven't found all the clues, she will tell them that he was always acting secretly, messing around with trash, "who knows why?"

Chickadee (if present) or a **DC 15 Religion** check will reveal that black-robed priests are devoted to [[dhoutr]]. There's a massive temple of Dhoutr in the city.

Vana will ask, "are those your friends?" and point to the end of the alleyway where two city guards are watching them from a distance. When they're spotted, they scatter.

## Temple of Dhoutr

## The Solution

TODO

## Outline

Chickadee and Callum go to "Colonus"/Phidippus for help who sells them a potion of false death as requested. Before the lovers leave his hut, he hands Callum a note to meet at *The Beacon* at night, alone. First, he has a hatchling dragon shipped to the Beacon under their names. When the dragon escapes at a certain time of night, it kills Callum and bit off his jaw to prevent speaking with the dead.

## OLD

??? info "The Solution"
    Chickadee is dead, but she wasn't supposed to die. Callum and Chickadee came up with the idea to draw attention to the plight of the people in Marram by staging a hate crime. The idea here was to fake her death to influence Callum's family, the Royal Family, to do something to help.

    They enlisted the help of a powerful magic user, who happened to be Phidippus disguised as Agorius, on his way through the city.

    Phidippus recognized Chickadee, and instead of using his magic to make her appear dead, he killed her outright.
