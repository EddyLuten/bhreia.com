# 🔐 Boonabell

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Bannaboona, a large obese Bullywug leader of the Boona gang, also happens to be a great inventor. He uses his ill-gotten gains to explore the ocean through his invention, the Boonabell. Problem is, a rival gang leader stole Bannaboona's Boonabell. Go get it back so you can dive into the deepest depths of the ocean.

## Boonabell

The Boonabell is a cramped submersible that uncomfortably seats five people. The Boonabell has grapple arms to collect samples and enough air for three days. It's small enough that it can be loaded on the back of a wagon with enough strength.

## Slick Sean

Slick Sean is the owner of Rayna's Castle in Korban's Landing, a franchise fast food eatery. He's also Bannaboona's greatest nemesis in Korban's Landing's underground. Besides the fast food joint, Slick Sean deals in stolen goods, one of which is the Boonabell.

## Getting it Back

There's a warehouse in the dock district where Slick Sean keeps his stolen wares. From here, he ships the stuff. The Boonabell is in the warehouse somewhere, which is protected around the clock by a Shield Guardian. This is something that Bannaboona will conveniently fail to mention.

Take it out and move the Boonabell back to Bannaboona's Denn.
