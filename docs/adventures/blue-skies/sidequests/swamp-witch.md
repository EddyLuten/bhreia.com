# üîê The Swamp Witch

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

An adaptation of The Swamp Witch by Nate Word.

This sidequest is triggered as the adventurers traverse Korban's Way westward towards [[korbans-landing]]. They walk onto a hillside and find strange stone animals on the side of the road. As they crest the hill, they come across the town of Midway.

## Entering Midway

The group comes across a small town named **Midway** with only a few houses and an inn. Here they can spend the night and rest.

Midway isn't much of a town and is composed of the following:

- 1 large alligator farm
- 6 squalid huts and houses
- 1 inn

## Jikan's Museum

Jikan (jee-kahn), a sixteen-year-old [[cuniko]] boy, has set up a museum of local oddities in an abandoned hut in town. Jikan named it the "Midway Mystery Museum" Inside the dilapidated shack are a wide variety of stone animals and curiosities.

Jikan will explain that he finds these stone animals all over town and in the countryside. More and more lately. He says that travelers gossip that there's a witch in the swamp who turns these animals to stone.

- A stone alligator, its mouth wide open and in an action pose
- Stone bugs
- Stone frogs
- A stone dog, looking afraid, surprised
- A **hatchling dragon** with a single eye crawled halfway out of its stone egg
  - This is a child of Dagaz, petrified by a Corrupted Chicken (below)

### The Inn

The **Radenia** (Meta: an anagram for *Ariadne*) inn offers overpriced lodging in a few tiny shared rooms. The owner takes advantage of the fact that it's the only safe place to stay out here in the boonies. On a large and prominent plaque behind the bar is an engraving with the words:

> Nothing is free but the sunrise.

The owner's name is **Garacan**, a male Minotaur who doesn't talk much and much less likes to listen. While lodgings at the Radenia inn are poor and shared between guests, Garacan still charges a premium for his services.

- Lodging: 5 sp per person per day
- Dining: 2 sp per person per meal
- Stables: 7 sp per animal per day

The kitchen is open from 7 AM to 7 PM, and the bar is open from 12:00 PM to 12:00 PM.

### The Setup

Garacan will warn them to stay away from the swamp when they check-in. He says that the animals have been more aggressive lately. Some alligator farmers are missing from town, though they were regulars at the bar. Garacan is afraid to go near.

While the adventurers stay at the inn, they can overhear a conversation between two travelers about hearing singing voices from the swamps. The second says that he saw strange-looking chickens in the swamp.

### The Hook

While the adventurers sleep, they startle awake by a loud noise downstairs: yelling, furniture breaking.

If they go to investigate, they see Garacan fight off two chickens who have busted in through a window. They seem crazed and are screaming wildly. As the adventurers enter the room, one of the chickens bites Garacan, who slowly begins to turn into stone. The last thing he manages to say is, "in the swamp!"

The chickens immediately switch targets and go for the adventurers.

BATTLE

!!! info "Corrupted Chickens."
    Take Cockatrice from MM pg. 42, reduce their HP to 20, make the petrify condition permanent, but reduce the CON DC to 7.

### The Alligator Farm

When the adventurers come upon the alligator farm, a terrible stench overwhelms them. The captive alligators died from starvation and lay rotting in their pens.

There's a chicken coop near the farmhouse, forced open *from the inside*. Inside, there are only rotten eggs and old blood on the straw floor.

The farmhouse is a log cabin three feet elevated on damp yet sturdy cypress poles pressed into hard clay. The structure is modest: three rooms and a loft above the main room, covering half its interior.

They'll see a mess of broken furniture inside and a rotting female skeleton mangled on the dining room floor as they enter. Old blood covers everything.

A **DC 15 Investigation** check reveals many scratches on the wooden ladder leading into the loft. A **Carrion Crawler** (MM pg. 37) made its home up there, and its many legs have scratched the wood bare.

Inside a small nightstand in the loft is a diary, the only valuable thing in this cabin.
