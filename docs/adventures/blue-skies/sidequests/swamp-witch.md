# 🔐 The Swamp Witch

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

An adaptation of The Swamp Witch, by Nate Word.

This sidequest is triggered as the adventurers traverse Korban's Way westward towards [[korbans-landing]]. They walk onto a hillside and find strange stone animals on the side of the road. As they crest the hill, they come across the town of Midway.

## Entering Midway

The group comes across a small town named **Midway** with only a few houses and a inn. Here they can spend the night and rest.

Midway isn't much of a town and is composed of the following:

- 1 large alligator farm
- 6 squalid huts and houses
- 1 inn

### The Inn

The inn, named the **Radenia**, offers overpriced lodging in a few tiny shared rooms. The owner of the place is taking advantage of the fact that this is the only safe place to stay out here in the middle of nowhere. On a large and prominent plaque behind the bar is an engraving with the words: *Nothing is free but the sunrise*.

The owner's name is **Garacan**, a male Minotaur who doesn't talk much and much less likes to be talked to. While the lodgings at the Radenia inn are poor and have to be shared between two people, Garacan still charges a premium for his services.

- Lodging: 5 sp per person per day
- Dining: 2 sp per person per meal
- Stables: 7 sp per animal per day

The kitchen is open from 7 AM to 7 PM, and the bar is open from 12:00 PM to 12:00 PM.

### The Setup

Garacan will warn them to stay away from the swamp when they check in. He says that the animals have been more aggressive lately. The alligator farmers near the swamp have not been heard from for some time, and they were regulars at the bar.

While the adventurers are staying at the inn, they can overhear a conversation between two travelers about hearing singing voices coming from the swamps. The second says that he saw strange looking chickens in the swamp.

### The Hook

While the adventurers sleep, they are awakened by a loud noise downstairs. Yelling, furniture breaking.

If they go to investigate, they see Garacan fight off two chickens who have busted in through a window. They seem crazed, are screaming wildly, and as the adventurers enter the room, one of the chickens bites Garacan, who slowly begins to turn into stone. The last thing he manages to say is "in the swamp!"

The chickens immediately switch targets and go for the adventurers.

BATTLE

!!! info "Corrupted Chickens"
    Take Cockatrice from MM pg. 42, reduce their HP to 20, make the petrify condition permanent, but reduce the CON DC to 7.

### The Alligator Farm

When the adventurers come upon the alligator farm, a terrible stink overwhelms them. All of the captive alligators have died from starvation and are rotting in their pens.

Near the farmhouse, there's a chicken coop. It's been forced open from the inside and within they only find rotten eggs and old blood on the straw floor covering.

The farmhouse itself is a log cabin sitting 3 ft. elevated on damp, but sturdy cypress poles. The cabin itself is modest in size. Three rooms and a loft above the main cabin, covering half the structure.

As they enter, the first thing they'll see is a mess of broken furniture inside and a rotting female skeleton mangled on the dining room floor. Everything is covered in old blood.

A DC 15 investigation check will show many scratches on the wooden ladder leading into the loft. A Carrion Crawler (MM pg. 37) has made its home up here, its many legs have scratched the wood bare.
