# üîê The Swamp Witch

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

An adaptation of The Swamp Witch by Nate Word.

This sidequest is triggered as the adventurers traverse Korban's Way westward towards [[korbans-landing]]. They walk onto a hillside and find strange stone animals on the side of the road. As they crest the hill, they come across the town of Midway.

## Entering Midway

The group comes across a small town named **Midway** with only a few houses and an inn. Here they can spend the night and rest.

Midway isn't much of a town and is composed of the following:

- 1 large alligator farm
- 6 squalid huts and houses
- 1 inn

## Jikan's Museum

Jikan (jee-kahn), a sixteen-year-old [[cuniko]] boy, has set up a museum of local oddities in an abandoned hut in town. Jikan named it the "Midway Mystery Museum" Inside the dilapidated shack are a wide variety of stone animals and curiosities.

Jikan will explain that he finds these stone animals all over town and in the countryside. More and more lately. He says that people gossip that there's a witch in the swamp who turns these animals to stone.

- A stone alligator, its mouth wide open and in an action pose
- Stone bugs
- Stone frogs
- A stone dog, looking afraid, surprised
- A **hatchling dragon** with a single eye crawled halfway out of its stone egg
  - This is a child of Dagaz, petrified by a Corrupted Chicken (below)

### The Inn

The **Radenia** inn offers overpriced lodging in a few tiny shared rooms. The owner of the place is taking advantage of the fact that this is the only safe place to stay out here in the middle of nowhere. On a large and prominent plaque behind the bar is an engraving with the words:

> Nothing is free but the sunrise.

The owner's name is **Garacan**, a male Minotaur who doesn't talk much and much less likes to be talked to. While the lodgings at the Radenia inn are poor and have to be shared between two people, Garacan still charges a premium for his services.

- Lodging: 5 sp per person per day
- Dining: 2 sp per person per meal
- Stables: 7 sp per animal per day

The kitchen is open from 7 AM to 7 PM, and the bar is open from 12:00 PM to 12:00 PM.

### The Setup

Garacan will warn them to stay away from the swamp when they check-in. He says that the animals have been more aggressive lately. The alligator farmers near the swamp have not been heard from for some time, and they were regulars at the bar.

While the adventurers stay at the inn, they can overhear a conversation between two travelers about hearing singing voices from the swamps. The second says that he saw strange-looking chickens in the swamp.

### The Hook

While the adventurers sleep, they are awakened by a loud noise downstairs: yelling, furniture breaking.

If they go to investigate, they see Garacan fight off two chickens who have busted in through a window. They seem crazed and are screaming wildly. As the adventurers enter the room, one of the chickens bites Garacan, who slowly begins to turn into stone. The last thing he manages to say is, "in the swamp!"

The chickens immediately switch targets and go for the adventurers.

BATTLE

!!! info "Corrupted Chickens"
    Take Cockatrice from MM pg. 42, reduce their HP to 20, make the petrify condition permanent, but reduce the CON DC to 7.

### The Alligator Farm

When the adventurers come upon the alligator farm, a terrible stink overwhelms them. All of the captive alligators have died from starvation and are rotting in their pens.

There's a chicken coop near the farmhouse, forced open *from the inside*. They only find rotten eggs inside the chicken coop and old blood on the straw floor.

The farmhouse is a log cabin sitting 3 ft. elevated on damp but sturdy cypress poles. The cabin itself is modest in size: three rooms and a loft above the main cabin, which covers half of the structure.

They'll see a mess of broken furniture inside and a rotting female skeleton mangled on the dining room floor as they enter. Everything is covered in old blood.

A **DC 15 Investigation** check reveals many scratches on the wooden ladder leading into the loft. A **Carrion Crawler** (MM pg. 37) made its home up there, and its many legs have scratched the wood bare.
