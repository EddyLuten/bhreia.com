# 🔐 Forlorn Freeney

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

On their way to the [[ironstone-forge]], the gang can run into [[freeney]], who has cut down a tree across the road again. He's up to his usual MO, but this time he's drunk as a skunk, only has a single hand crossbow, and is without his son.

In his other hand is a bottle of booze, sloshing half full, wetting his hand as he trundles and leans on the cut tree.

    H-How do you do?

    It's up to me to tell you - to tell you - to put your... hands up in the air if you know what's right for you.

    There's no need for this to get ugly, just put your hands up, sir.

Freeney will accidentally shoot a bolt with disadvantage because of his state and will apologize while reloading clumsily and sitting down.

If pressed, he will recognize Wolf as the "cigar man," and tell him that he made a pretty penny off those boxes. He and his son lived off that bounty for days until he was killed in the disaster.

He will start crying, but won't let them pass.

He can be convinced to stop threatening them, and will ask for a new bottle of booze.
