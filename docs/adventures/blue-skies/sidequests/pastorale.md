    My heaven blue with golden harp
    My cumulus clouds, crystals of ice
    The comets, the moons, and the planets,
    ah all revolves about me
    And through the gate of whitest clouds till deep beneath the waves
    Pervades my fire, my love, itself into the earth
    And along the water plays a child
    And all the shells that they find glisten when I smile

    I love your warmth upon my face
    I love the copper hue of you light
    I give you water in my hand
    And shells from the salted sand
    I hold you dear, so dear

    I shred rocks with my beam
    Raise the lakes in the valleys and
    Stormy skies I make them flee,
    ah when the rain falls
    Hide your eye in my hand
    Before my smile burns them
    My fire, my love, my golden eyes
    It's better if you wait a while
    Because soon comes the night and shines the cool moon

    The night is too cold, the moon too gray
    Please, take me with you to your heavenly palace
    There I want to be alone with you
    Beaming in your heavenly blue
    I hold you dear, so dear

    When I intend to warm the earth
    I allow her to live in my embrace
    From stars I weaved the distance,
    ah the northern lights
    But sometimes I am as boiling lead
    I am the living and the dead
    In fire, in love, in all the ages
    My child, I comfort you, look above
    Today I span my rainbow
    It is just for you.

    No, not for a second do I stand still
    I'd rather burn, take me with you
    No man can force my will
    When you sleep in the sea tonight
    No life that I didn't begin
    And fly along your heavenly orbit
    You can't love the sun
    I don't want to leave you anymore.

    I hold you dear, so dear
    I hold you dear, so dear
    I hold you dear, so dear
    I hold you dear, so dear
