# üîê Pastorale

WIP

Random encounter along the road with Cauda's traveling musical shadow puppet show. This is another one of Cauda's appearances to the adventurers, though this time attempting to explain some of the nuances between [[amalchi]] and [[bhreia]].

The traveling show is called [Circus Jeroen Bosch](https://nl.wikipedia.org/wiki/Het_Land_van_Maas_en_Waal).

Cauda's not trying to hide his identity and looks the same as in the first session. However, he's wearing a top hat and a dress jacket.

    My heaven blue with golden arc  
    My towering clouds and crystals of ice  
    The comets, the moons, and the planets,  
    ah, all revolves 'round me.  
    And through the gate of whitest clouds  
    till deep beneath the waves pervades  
    my fire, my love, itself in the earth  
    And along the water plays a child  
    And all the shells that they find glisten when I smile

    Your warmth on my face is a delight,  
    I so love the copper hues of your light  
    I give you water in my hand  
    And shells from the salted sand  
    I hold you dear, so dear

    I tear rocks apart with my beams  
    Raise the lakes in the valleys  
    and stormy skies they run from me,  
    ah, when the rain pours down.  
    Hide your eyes in my embrace  
    Before my smile sets them ablaze  
    My fire, my love, my golden eyes  
    It's better if you wait a while  
    Because soon comes the night and shines the cool moon

    The night is too cold, the moon too gray  
    Please, take me with you to your heavenly place  
    There I want to be alone with you  
    Beaming in your heavenly blue  
    I hold you dear, so dear

    When I intend to warm the earth  
    I allow her to live in my embrace  
    From stars I weaved the distance,  
    ah, the northern lights.  
    But sometimes I am as boiling lead  
    I am the living and the dead  
    In fire, in love, in all the ages  
    My child, I comfort you, look above  
    Today I span my rainbow  
    It is just for you.

    No, not for a second do I stand still  
    I'd rather burn, take me with you  
    No man can force my will  
    When you sleep in the sea tonight  
    No life that I didn't begin  
    And fly along your heavenly orbit  
    You can't love the sun  
    I don't want to leave you anymore.

    I hold you dear, so dear  
    I hold you dear, so dear  
    I hold you dear, so dear  
    I hold you dear, so dear

    I burn in heavens blue, my blaze,  
    my golden light and savage rays.  
    Galaxies, moons, planets, and stars,  
    all revolve 'round me.  
    And through the clouds, the air, the waves,  
    under the waters, I permeate  
    my passion, my love, into the earth...

    And along the shore a child I see,  
    And all the shells they find for me - they gleam upon my smile.
