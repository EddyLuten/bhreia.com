# 🔐 Korban's Memorial

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

!!! Info "Approaching"
    At the center of a grassy field, situated deep within the pine forest of Korban's Ruin, stands a statue atop a pedestal. Worn by centuries of weather, its features and details are long gone. You can make out the vague depiction of a figure on its knees. It looks defeated. From its back and out its chest is the remainder of what looks like a sword, skewering the figure. The grassy field is circular, forming a 100-foot radius clearing around the memorial. Judging by the wear marks on the field, it seems like people occasionally set up camp here while traveling through the area.

On closer inspection, this can be read on the pedestal in [[old-common]] with a **DC 15 History** check:

!!! Quote "On the Pedestal"
    KORBAN  
    Son of Bhreia.  
    Our nation's father: slayer of Amalchi.  
    His sacrifice is salvation.

On the reverse side of the memorial, a seam, detectable with a **DC 17 Perception** check, outlines a hidden entrance.

!!! Quote "Hidden Entrance"
    You spot a thin seam in the pedestal, tracing the outline of a passage. Though, there's no handle, knob, or lever visible to open it. However, faintly engraved on the stone in an uncommon combination of Elven and [[old-common]], you read the words "enter friend of Darvia."

This inscription is a callback to [[cauldins-sword]], which bears the inscription:

> To Cauldin of Leikon, Friend of Darvia. May his foes tremble before him.

If Cauldin's Sword comes within 1 foot of the door, a thin slot appears and will hold the sword in place there with an audible click. The sword can be used to swing the now-unlocked door open.

!!! Quote "Opening"
    The sword's blade locks in place with an audible click, and deep within the structure, something moves to unlock the door. You try to pull the sword from the slot, but instead of removing it, the door opens, revealing a narrow staircase leading down into the earth below the memorial.

The sword is *stuck* in the slot until the door is closed. The pathway is wide enough for a single person to walk through. The air smells stale, and the deeper they go, the smell of methane becomes more pronounced.

## Water and Fire

The staircase twists into a water-filled chamber stretching out a hundred feet. The chamber is 15 feet wide and at the other end is a door, visible above the water line. This room is pitch black, so the party will need to find a source of light that will not ignite the methane buildup in this room. The smell of methane seems to come from this room as the gas occasionally bubbles up from the water. Lined along the walls at 10-foot intervals are unlit sconces facing each other.

!!! Quote "On lighting the room"
    The 15-foot-wide room is filled with water running towards you, making it difficult to stand in place. The water covers you up to your hips. At the end of the room, just above the waterline, an old half-rotten door provides the only exit. Lining the walls at ten-foot intervals are ten unlit sconces on each side.

A **DC 15 Investigation** check would reveal that a thin metal wire connects the sconces on opposing sides. A new Investigation is required for each of them to determine if a wire is present and its location. Some are below the water, some along the waterline, and others in the air. It is possible to disarm each of these traps with a **DC 17 Thieves Tools** check.

Triggering these traps will cause the sconce to ignite and explode the methane buildup in the room. A successful **DC 18 Dexterity** check will allow the party to duck below the waterline before igniting the room. On failure, the party member receives **4d6 fire damage**.

## Korban's Prison

!!! Quote "On opening the door."
    You push on the door, which breaks into rotten chunks in your hands. An odor of wet mold briefly fills the air as the door's remains crumble to the ground. When you peer into the next room, you first notice a large framed image portraying a moving landscape. You realize you're looking at a cultivated wheat field gently rippling in the breeze under a bright midday sun. Stretching out into the distance is a dark road that contrasts against the reddish soil and dried grasses surrounding it. The blue midday sky switches for a pitch-black canvas embroidered with bright stars. A voice calls out as you try to figure out what's happening.

Those who understand Elvish:

> Please. Please. Is someone there?

!!! Quote "Korban"
    Laying on a bed of his grown-out white hair inside a glass sphere, you see an ancient Elvish figure slowly moving to face your direction. "I hear you," he calls out. His blind eyes aimlessly search for something to see. Slowly, he lifts himself with his spindly limbs and rests his naked body against the sphere's surface. His skin is thin as rice paper, translucent, showing his squirming insides below its surface. On his chest is a large scar, healed long ago but still red and wet with inflammation. "Who visits me today?"

Korban was trapped in this sphere 872 years ago. He only speaks Elvish.

**Why is he there?** After having slain Amalchi in human form, Donitar, one of the Leikon brothers, trapped him down here. The sphere has magical properties that keep him alive indefinitely but don't stop his aging.

**Why did Donitar do this?** He was a secret follower of Amalchi taking revenge. Over the years, other followers of Amalchi have visited Korban to gloat over his condition.

**Any lately?** Yes, though he doesn't know precisely how long ago. A man visited him, but Korban was blind by then, so he couldn't see him. He also doesn't quite know how much time has passed.

**What is the painting?** It's a portal to predetermined destinations:

- Earth, a road through a wheat field somewhere.
  > A dark road cuts through fields of wheat growing on reddish soil. The sky is bright blue and the sun shines brightly overhead.
- The lunar colony.
  > A starry sky over the outlines of buildings. What vaguely resembles a sailing vessel flies overhead and takes off into the sky.
- What's left of [[cauldins-point]].
  > The survivors' camp at Cauldin's Point. People are standing in line, waiting for food.
- Mt. Amarantos
  > You look down the mouth of a volcano into the hot bubbling mass below. It's hard to tell, but it looks like a large creature swims through it.
