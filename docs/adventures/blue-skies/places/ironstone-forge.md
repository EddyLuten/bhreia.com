## Ironstone Reacquisition

While [[tiran]] was missing, his parents [[sophia]] and [[malachi]] have reclaimed the Ironstone Forge. They have started manufacturing time keeping devices while the sun is static in the sky. One of these can be found in the [[survivors-camp]].

The forge is currently solely run by [[sophia]] while [[malachi]] is abroad (see his page for details). She's helped by [[phidippus|Agorius]], who infuses the time keeping devices with the magic they need to operate.
