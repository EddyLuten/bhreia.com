# 🔐 Ironstone Forge

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

## Founding

The Ironstone Forge was founded in 2934 by the first Hanlar Ironstone and subsequently inherited and operated by further Hanlars.

See: [[hanlar]] for details.

## Acquisition by Phidippus

After having killed Hanlar Ironstone, [[phidippus]] enjoyed watching the generational business fall apart in a matter of weeks. Orders went unfulfilled, taxes went unpaid, and after no heirs claimed the property and debts, Phidippus found himself able to buy the property for next to nothing.

Here, he inexpertly ran the construction projects required to raise [[amalchi]], including the glass tubes that fed blood into [[moreus]]' body from a reservoir underneat Cauldin's Tomb.

## Ironstone Reacquisition

[[phidippus]] went missing after the destruction of Cauldin's Point and after a few months had gone by of missing his payments, the bank put the place up for sale. While [[tiran]] was missing, and after traveling to [[cauldins-point]], his parents [[sophia]] and [[malachi]] have purchased the Ironstone Forge.

They began manufacturing time keeping devices while the sun is static in the sky. One of these can be found in the [[survivors-camp]]. The forge is currently solely run by [[sophia]] while [[malachi]] is abroad (see his page for details). She's helped by [[phidippus|Agorius]], who infuses the time keeping devices with the magic they need in order to operate.
