# 🔐 Madame Mollisher's

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Madame Mollisher's is a brothel in [[korbans-landing]]'s Old City neighborhood. The brothel's owner is the eponymous Madame Morgan Mollisher, a Half-Orc who established the business in 2069.

Though uncommon, lodging is available upon request but at a steep surcharge.

## People

### The Madame

Morgan Mollisher is originally from [[rivoni-springs]], part of the infamous Mollisher family in charge of operating the gondolas there. She fled to Korban's Landing after she learned that a price was put on her head there by a rival family.

### Employees

**Robin Sola:** A middle-aged female prostitute of Human descent who occasionally runs the brothel in Morgan's stead.

**Ellie Buck:** A young female prostitute of Half-Elf descent. Native to Korban's Landing, the daughter of a human prostitute who became impregnated on the job.

**Brynn Garron:** A middle-aged male prostitute of Half-Orc descent. Rejected by his tribe in Taïni, Brynn makes a living here.

**Glimmer:** A young gender-neutral prostitute of Elven descent. While the others all carry a certain sadness, Glimmer seems quite content with their occupation.

**Mister:** A burly, battle-worn middle-aged [[cuniko]] male. In charge of the bar and security in the brothel.

??? Danger "DM: Passi"
    A level of trust can be established by mentioning that Passi/Pasiphae sent the group to the brothel. Though she's now on the straight and narrow, Pasiphae used to be a prostitute at Madame Mollisher's. Her husband, Garacan, doesn't know this.
