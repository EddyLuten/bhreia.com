Rank: Captain

Company: [[au]]

Weslan is a Captain in the ranks of the Aldarion Unlimited adventuring company. He currently is in charge of running the [[survivors-camp]] at [[cauldins-point]] and he's tired of being there.

He's not a bad guy, but just wants to hurry up the rebuilding efforts already. Politics seem to be getting in the way of progress. He just wants to go back to exploring.

## Personal Connections

He's fallen in love with [[londrina]] over the past year, but has been keeping his feelings to himself due to the negative feelings towards dragonborn lately.

He reported back from [[marram]] lately, and has met [[phillipe]] there. All he knows about his situation is that he's supposed to have headed back when finding out [[dauriel]] is missing or dead.

He reports directly to [[kvint]].
