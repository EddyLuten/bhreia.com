# 🔐 Ix's Mother

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

- Full name: Rala Jechta
- Age: 203
- Family: Ix (deceased child)

Though now in her final years of her life, Rala was a decorated warrior in her day. Born in Dorr into a military family, Rala followed in her ancestors' footsteps and quickly rose in the ranks of the Dorr Army to the rank of general. Though she held a high rank, she was ever-present on the battlefield. For each kill, she carved a hash mark onto the skin of her arm until there was no more skin left to scar.

Even though she was successful on a personal level, the Dorrian government that Rala supported eventually fell and she and her entire family fled to [[korbantir]] where she's living out the remainder of her days.

## Appearance

Crumpled up in a rocking chair on the porch of a house that needed a paint job thirty years ago sits an old Tiefling woman puffing on a long clay pipe. Her thin hair frames her gaunt face inset with small blind eyes that nonetheless appear to see you coming. As you watch her rock back and forth, she watches you approach. She holds out a shaky arm covered in hundreds of small vertical scars, clutching a rusty dagger. "What's your business here?"

## Getting the Code

Rala's favorite song is the Dorrian battle song "From the Depths, Across the Plains."

> From the depths, across the plains,  
> the enemy is slain.  
> A sharpened blade, our hearts afire,  
> advance 'til none remain.  
> Our minds and bodies move as one,  
> for country and our Lord.  
> When His day comes, 'o may it come,  
> we fight from that day forth.  
> When His day comes, 'o may it come,  
> we fight from that day forth.  
>
> Until then, across the plains,  
> the enemy is slain.  
> I hone my blade, and keep it close,  
> so I won't break the chain.  
> My brothers and my sisters bound by blood  
> and no reward.  
> When His day comes, 'o may it come,  
> we fight with blood and sword.
> When His day comes, 'o may it come,  
> we fight with blood and sword.
