Sophia Medeid (nee Ironstone) is the wife of [[malachi]] and mother of [[tiran]].

She speaks with a normal accent since she was raised in [[cauldins-point]].

## Bio

Sophia grew up around the [[ironstone-forge]] near Cauldin's Point, and was in line to succeed Hanlar Ironstone, her father upon his passing. However, she fell in love with [[malachi]] and was ostracized from her family when her father found out. They moved to Kleftmon in the north of [[korbantir]] where they had Tiran.

## Situational Background

See [[malachi]]'s situational background for context.

Sophia stayed behind to run the [[ironstone-forge]] and with the help of a local magic user who survived the disaster, construct the time keeping devices.

## Current Situation

Sophia hasn't heard back from Malachi since he left. She also hasn't heard anything about Tiran, Gadot, or [[phillipe]]. She's feeling very lonely and her magic user friend has been consoling her and keeping her company.

This, of course, is a very damaged [[phidippus]] working under the fake name of "Agorius," another jumping spider genus.
