# üîê Sophia Medeid

Sophia is the wife of [[malachi]] and mother of [[tiran]].

## Situational Background

See [[malachi]]'s situational background for context.

Sophia stayed behind to run the [[ironstone-forge]] and with the help of a local magic user who survived the disaster, construct the time keeping devices.

## Current Situation

Sophia hasn't heard back from Malachi since he left. She also hasn't heard anything about Tiran, Gadot, or [[phillipe]]. She's feeling very lonely and her magic user friend has been consoling her and keeping her company.

This, of course, is a very damaged [[phidippus]] working under the fake name of "Agorius," another jumping spider genus.
