Dr. Anton Malchi was born in Antwerp, Belgium, in 1952. He was the project lead on the Fermilab [Tevatron particle accelerator](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tevatron) until his disappearance in 1994.

He and his research partner, Bhreia Ahrda, have been researching generating [microscopic black holes and extra dimensions](https://home.cern/science/physics/extra-dimensions-gravitons-and-tiny-black-holes) that could occur during particle colissions. In 1994 they observed five simulatneous events after collision which Dr. Malchi dismissed. However, after the particles decayed, he and his research partner were pulled into a dimensional rift, into Bhreia.
