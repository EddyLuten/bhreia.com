Londrina is a purple Dragonborn priestess of Primani who is present at the [[survivors-camp]] after the destruction of [[cauldins-point]].

Before that, she ran the temple of Primani in downtown Cauldin's Point.

During [[amalchi]]'s rise from below Cauldin's Point, she was directly struck by the dragon and therefore is encrusted with permanent obsidian crystals embedded within her skin.

## Connections

She's unaware of [[weslan]]'s feelings towards her, but she likes him too.

She remembers [[sah-sauj]] visiting her on the day before the disaster, but not the others.

She may put two and two together and tie Sah-Sauj to the rise of Amalchi. She will surely ask him about his religion again when they meet. Depending on how this plays out, she could try to get Weslan to investigate them or something more drastic.
