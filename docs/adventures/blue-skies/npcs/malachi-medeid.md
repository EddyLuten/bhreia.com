# 🔐 Malachi Medeid

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Malachi is the husband of [[sophia]] and father of [[tiran]]. He's also a high level wizard.

He speaks with a different accent than Tiran and Sophia.

## Biography

Born in Taïni, but eventually moved to Korbantir where he met and married [[sophia]].

## Situational Background

After learning about the disaster in Cauldin's Point, knowing that their son was there, they immediately left home to go look for him and [[gadot]]. Much like the others, they also found that Tiran and Gadot were missing, presumed dead.

When they met and spoke with [[weslan]], the camp's leader, they realized that they both knew [[phillipe]], and that he should have been back by now.

They decided that Sophia could stay here and Malachi should go look for his friend, Phillipe in [[marram]]. Though well traveled, Malachi was hesitant to leave on this dangerous quest alone. But he eventually agreed once Weslan convinced [[chickadee]] to guide him there since she was headed home anyway with [[dauriel]], her employer, still missing.

## Current Situation

* Did he make it to Marram with Chickadee?
* Where is he?
