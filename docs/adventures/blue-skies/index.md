--8<-- "spoiler.html"

This adventure is a direct follow up to [Dauriel's Mansion](../dauriels-mansion/index.md).

- People have mostly lost track of time.
- Amalchi has turned into a dragon and flown away.

### What's Left of Cauldin's Point

Cauldin's Point is in ruins. The town itself has been reduced to a large hole that's filled up with water, forming a lake.

There's a camp set up south west of town, hundreds of tents set up in neat rows and columns. They're the survivors and those looking for loved ones stay here. It's organized by the provincial government, and they've outsourced the work to Aldarion Unlimited, who run the show.

There's a board with the names of those still missing

- Rhea and Junior Feldspar
- Kolwyn, the stable boy
- Londrina, the priestess of Primani
- Dauriel Aldarion
- Moreus Aldarion
- Grottle

More than a thousand souls in total are dead or missing.

#### Entering the Camp

As they enter the camp, an Aldarion Unlimited spokesperson stands on a small podium in the middle of a rowdy crowd attempting to calm them down.

    *Spokesperson:* Now, calm down people, we're doing the best we can here, given the situation. We haven't given up on your loved ones, but you have to admit that after a year the chances of finding survivors is slim to none. From now on, we're going to focus on rebuilding the town and finding you homes.

    *The crowd grunts, but they dont' seem to disagree entirely.*

    *Woman:* What about the gawkers? Are you going to do anything about them?

    *Spokesperson:* The tours are.. tasteless, yes, but we've kept them away long enough, and since the site is no longer deemed hazardous, it's open to the public.

    *Woman:* That site you're talking about is our home town.

## Act II

- Finding the dragon in Marram.
