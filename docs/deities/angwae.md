# Angwae

Angwae is the god of fire, heat, the forge, and burning passion.

**Pronunciation:** ang-way

**Plane of Existence:** Plane of fire

**Domains:** fire, forges, heat, passion

He is the child of [[primani]], who created him to aid her creations in staying warm during cold times.

He's often revered as a minor god by blacksmiths (though not worshipped), not because he can grant them anything, but to stave off his scornful judgment on their abilities to tame the fires. It is said that novice blacksmiths are under the constant gaze of Angwae and therefore often fail until they are seen to be worthy in Angwae's eyes.

## Etymology (Meta)

From PIE h₁n̥gʷnís, meaning *fire*, or the personification thereof.
