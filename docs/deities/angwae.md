# Angwae

Pronunciation: ang-way

Angwae is the god of fire, heat, the forge, and burning passion.

He is the child of [[primani]], who created him to aid her creations in staying warm during cold times.

He's often revered to as a minor god by blacksmiths, not because he can grant them anything, but to stave off his scornful judgment on their abilities to tame the fires. It is said that novice blacksmiths are under the constant gaze of Angwae and therefore often fail until they are seen to be worthy in Angwae's eyes.

## Etymology (Meta)

From PIE h₁n̥gʷnís, meaning *fire*, or the personification thereof.
