# Dhoutr

God of death, constructed by [[brother]] from his own body. Ruler of the Internal Plane of Darkness.

**Pronunciation:** dow-ter

**Plane of Existence:** Internal Plane of Darkness

**Domains:** Death, corruption, disease, anxiety.

Created in a fit of jealous anger by Bhreia's nameless brother (see [[timeline]]), Dhoutr slithered as a shapeless dark mass from the skies and settled deep within Bhreia where he has corrupted the souls of every living person since. Upon the death of a creature, their spirits are sent to his domain and doomed to roam there forever. Their eternal suffering feeds Dhoutr, who in turn remains powerful enough to continue his corrupting influence. Despite the negative connotation that he brings, some say that his arrival is what brought great great balance to the world. Still, others say that without death, the world would be a better place.

??? danger "DM: Supplemental Facts"
    The plane that Dhoutr rules is a sort of inferno, with the most egregious crimes being punished internally while the outer layers are more like a purgatory. The living don't know the details of this plane since it can only be visited by those truly dead.

    **TODO:** This needs work.
