Pronunciation: Ah-mel-khai

Amalchi is the male god of the sky and represents duality and instability, expressed in the day and night cycle. Whereas his counterpart [Bhreia](bhreia.md) is at least partially remembered by the inhabitants of the world, his name has been completely forgotten except by his cult followers who understand and know his true nature.

**Domains:** Air, sky, daylight, darkness of night. Duality vs Bhreia's stability.

**Effects:** While his essence is present in the elemental plane of air, the day and night cycle continues as usual. Once incarnated, whatever the time of day was, will persist.

**Beliefs:** Duality principle (similar to yin and yang). Actions must have consequences. For every good, there is an evil. Contradicting forces can be complimentary. Good and evil are morally relative. Chaos is not disorder, it is a natural state.

The sky is ever changing from day to night, two opposites present in a single entity.

The sun is the day-eye. The moons are the night eyes.

## True Form

While Amalchi can inhabit a willing host, this is only done for a certain period of gestation. After he has amassed enough power into the host body, it undergoes a process of transformation whereby the original host body is discarded like an empty molt from which the fully formed Amalchi sprouts.

Its final shape is that of a **Sky Blue Dragon**, vacillating between the day sky and the night sky. It has six eyes, laid out like five smaller white eyes surrounding a large eye that radiates pure sunlight. Amalchi's symbol is a fairly close approximation of these eyes. They represent the sun and the five moons, which Amalchi controls. Amalchi is extremely large and when his wings envelop a person or persons, they are transported to the plane of air.

## Attempts at Incarnation

Much like Bhreia, Amalchi is also alive and well in the elemental plane of air. However, unlike his sister who is loved by so many and surrounded by her family, he's itching to incarnate and be around those who he will make worship him. Yet, his is unable to do this on his own. As much as he's tried, he can only create other deities and ghastly spirits that haunt the world. The only times he was able to create anything worthwhile was together with Bhreia, who has given up on him. Because of this limitation, he keeps an eye out for those people willing to submit to him and grant him possession over their bodies.

### Many Days of Night

His first attempt was during the Third Age, in 2208 when Amalchi left his duties as the sky and manifested himself in a human form. Bhreia, sensing the disturbance and desiring stability in the world above all, appeared to Korban, an Elven leader and explorer, and imbued him with the power to slay Amalchi. As such things must, Korban and Amalchi eventually faced off in what's now known as the forest of Korban's Ruin and battled. Amalchi, with his divine insight, was able to surprise attack Korban and his group and fatally wounded him. However, before Korban succumbed to his wounds, he was able to slay Amalchi's corporeal form and banish him from the world again. Amalchi's followers scattered into the woods and were never heard of again.

### Again, as Moreus

His followers, of course, reassembled and concocted a plan to get Amalchi back onto the surface of the world. This time, they met in total clandestine conditions, separated from society in secret catacombs they built underneath their human settlement near the town that's now named Cauldin's Point. The place was built as both a focus for the power of Amalchi, being at the dead center of the world, and a safe haven for his followers. It wasn't until 800 years after Korban's assassination, during the early years of the Fourth Age that they once again succeeded.

One of his followers, a man named [Moreus](../adventures/dauriels-mansion/npcs/moreus.md), offered his body as the receptacle for Amalchi's life force, knowing that his own essence would be erased from existence, and so it was. Bhreia, once again sensing the imbalance that she so hated, came to Dauriel Aldarion (he doesn't know, but he's a descendent of Korban) in a vision and told him to stop the process while it was not yet completed. In the end, he partially succeeded, without direct help from the goddess, and was able to store a part of Amalchi's spirit in an orb built from his party's life forces as well as most of his own.

Enough of Amalchi exists in the elemental plane of air to keep the day and night cycle going, but this fractured existence is an unstable situation -- and Dauriel knows it.

## Followers

The followers of Amalchi are known as the [Cult of Amalchi](../adventures/dauriels-mansion/organizations/cult-of-amalchi.md) and operate clandestinely. They are trying to bring about balance to a world that they perceive to be unbalanced. See their page for details.

## Etymology (Meta)

From Latin malus, meaning *bad*, evil, wicked, etc.

## Children

* [Melora](melora.md) with Bhreia.
* [Dhoutr](dhoutr.md) out of his own body.
