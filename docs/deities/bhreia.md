## Mythology

Not much is known about Bhreia except that she was one of the first two primordial mythological deities. The name of the other deity has been lost to the dusty depths of the ages. It is supposed that these two deities are the personifications of the world (the earth, Bhreia) and the heavens (the sky, the unnamed deity), whose origins are attributed to natural processes by some or other deities by others.
