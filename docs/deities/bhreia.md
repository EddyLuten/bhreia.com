## Mythology

Not much is known about Bhreia outside of the broad strokes lined out in the creation mythology. She and her brother were the first two primordial deities and are responsible for the creation of life. The name of the her brother has been lost to the dusty depths of the ages. It is supposed that these two deities are the personifications of the world (the stable earth, Bhreia) and the heavens (the two-faced sky, the unnamed deity), whose origins are attributed to natural processes by some or different deities by others.
