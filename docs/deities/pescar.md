# Pescar

**Pronunciation:** pes-kar

**Domains:** Nautical life.

God of nautical creatures, such as fish and sea mammals.

Pescar is the child of [[primani]] and [[melora]], brought to life to watch over the deep seas and its creatures. He rules this domain with his wife **Merian**, after whom the Merian Sea was named.

## Worship

Though not directly worshipped by many, fishermen make offerings to Pescar and his mother before setting out to sea. Many harbors feature altars dedicated to Pescar, Melora, and Merian.
