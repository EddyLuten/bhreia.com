# The Fates

Though often referred to in song, scripture, prophecy, and other literature, it's unclear if The Fates actually exist. References to them are vague and often attribute to them the planning of future events or potential futures. It is thought that much like Bhreia, The Fates are a personification of a natural process. There are no known interactions between The Fates and any other deities or creatures.
