Ashwood trees are deciduous trees natively found on the eastern shores of the Dracsis Peninsula from Low Maris to the northernmost tip of [[korbantir]]. These trees can easily be identified by their red leaves year-round except in winter when they are shed. The name "ashwood" comes from the fact that when wood from these trees is burnt, the fire burns brightly, but shortly and leaving behind many ashes.

In the countries where these trees are native, their wood is often used in the construction of homes, ships, and other load-bearing applications due to its high tensile strength.
