An oily black stone only found in the vicinity of temples dedicated to [[dhoutr]]. Due to the oily nature of the stone, scholars think this stone is formed when porous volcanic material hardens inside of an oil. However, this hypothesis goes untested since this stone hasn't been found anywhere on Bhreia other than near the temples of Dhoutr. Many thus believe that this stone is a magical artifact rather than a natural one.
