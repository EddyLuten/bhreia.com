Bhreia (bray-ah) is a setting designed for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. If you were guided here by your DM, know that this documentation is provided as a supplemental resource to the official documentation and is **not required** reading. Instead, it's a resource empowering you to create a character more deeply integrated with the setting by providing details for you to riff off. Everything presented here is **common knowledge** to anyone living in the world unless noted otherwise.
