Bhreia (bray-ah) is a fantasy setting created for use with TTRPGs. If you were guided here by your DM, know that this documentation is a supplemental resource to the official documentation and is **not required** reading. Instead, it's a resource empowering you to create a character more integrated with the setting by providing details to riff off.

This wiki also keeps track of the [[braving-bhreia]] campaign run by its author.

Almost everything presented here is **common knowledge** to anyone living in this setting.

## World Map

To get a copy of the complete world map, [**click here**](assets/images/world-map-full.png). This map is a continual work in progress and will change over time. For maps of individual regions or countries, see their respective pages.

## DM Specific Content

Beware of content explicitly marked with a **DM** prefix, a lock icon 🔐, a blurred-out page, or a collapsible section.
Some page titles are also scrambled since they can potentially spoil the story. Above the navigation is a button that allows you to undo this.

??? danger "DM: An example."
    Reading the information in these sections will 100% spoil your game.

These pages are meant for the DM only and intended for them to reveal at their discretion.
