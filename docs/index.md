Bhreia (bray-ah) is a setting designed for the 5th edition of Dungeons & Dragons. If you were guided here by your DM, know that this documentation is provided as a supplemental resource to the official documentation and is **not required** reading. Instead, it's a resource empowering you to create a character more deeply integrated with the setting by providing details for you to riff off.

Almost everything presented here is **common knowledge** to anyone living in this setting unless explicitly marked with: a **DM** prefix, a lock icon 🔐, or a collapsible section, like so:

??? danger "DM: An example"
    Reading information in these sections will spoil your game.

This wiki is also used to keep track of the [Braving Bhreia](campaigns/dauriels-mansion-roll20.md) campaign run by its author.
