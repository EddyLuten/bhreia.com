# Human Trinity

The Human Trinity was a militant human supremacy group based in [[korbantir]] which was active during the [[history-age-3|Third Age]]. It was formed as a knee-jerk response to the sudden influx of Elves from Darvia into the country. The organization lasted for a few hundred years until it slowly faded into nothingness as the country became a melting pot for all cultures.

While active, the Human Trinity was responsible for hundreds of murders in Korbantir. Most notably, the Human Trinity claims the assassination of Korban.
