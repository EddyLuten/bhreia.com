# 🔐 Phidippus' Necklace

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Found by Sophia Ironstone on the ground outside Phidippus' old quarters, a silver necklace with a pendant holding an obsidian stone.

The obsidian is not attached to the pendant but seems to be suspended within a silver ring where it slowly levitates and rotates freely.
