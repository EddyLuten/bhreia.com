Owlbear Brandy is produced in Parlina by the Owlbear Brandy distillery. Though it has the word "brandy" in its name, it is in fact *not* a brandy but a whiskey. The name comes from the proprietor of the distillery, Brandy who once fought an owlbear with her bare fists in the woods outside Agado and won. "Owlbear Brandy" became her nickname and mascot for her new business, which produced whiskey.
