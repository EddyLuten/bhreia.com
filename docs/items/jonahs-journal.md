# 🔐 Jonah's Journal

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

## 22nd of Nerrulox, 3020

The university has sent me and my staff on a mission to Kleftmon. Some miner has stumbled across a two thousand year old vase in an abandone mineshaft. From the way it was described to me, it's possibly from the time of Cauldin and Donitar -- two thousand years old. I'm anxious to find out if there's anything more. We should arrive at the site tomorrow, Melora willing.

## 23rd of Nerrulox, 3020

My first impressions of the site were not encouraging. The mineshaft was carved within the last Age, so the vase must have been placed there fairly recently. I was hoping for an archaeological breakthrough, but the prospect of this seems bleak. We're heading back underground tomorrow to make our final assessment of the site and to transfer possession of the vase to the university.

## 29th of Nerrulox, 3020

I don't know where to start. It's been almost a week since my last entry. My previous assessment was wrong. SO WRONG. It seems that the mineshaft was not a mineshaft after all, but a tunnel leading into a cave. Whoever placed the vase in the tunnel took it out of the cave because we've found dozens more like it. The cave is filled with two thousand year old artifacts: vases, mosaics, old swords, tapestries, all maginificently preserved. I can't believe my luck. I have informed the university and they have sent us a stipend to continue working here indefinitely. I am overjoyed.

Though, one thing I can't figure out is how all of these items ended up in this cave. From what I can tell, the tunnel is the only way in, though the cave itself is much older. Teleportation magic? Maybe. But how would they have known there was a cave there?

## 1st of Bhreianium, 3021

Bhreia's blessings are truly upon us in this new year. Today, the cave produced its most interesting find to date. While most artifacts were placed out in the open, I noticed the bust hidden between some rubble. I don't know how I saw it, but I am glad that I did. It's the most beautiful sculpture I have ever laid eyes on. Its depicts a person, not quite human, though I don't know what it is. The face is slightly smiling and has two small knobby horns on its forehead, very strange indeed. And though its eyes are featureless, it gives me the distinct impression that it's looking at me. If I didn't know any better, I'd say it was alive. I know it's a silly thing to say, but each time I look at it, it's how I feel. I have taken it with me into my tent, and am looking at it now. It's magnificent. Just magnificent.

## 3rd of Bhreianium, 3021

I'm having a hard time tearing myself away from the bust. I've spent today in my tent studying it while my team continues the research. But I think we've found what we came here for. It's a magnificent bust, it truly is.

## 5th of Bhreianium, 3021

I've been having a recurring dream. The face of the bust. It speaks to me, tells me to do things. Tells me to listen. I can hardly sleep anymore. It's there each time I close my eyes. I wake up exhausted. There was an accident at the cave. It collapsed and most of the artifacts are crushed inside. The bust is safe, though. It's safe with me.

## 10th of Bhreianium, 3021

I think the bust may contain a spirit. I think I am a conduit for it. My team left for the university today, but I stayed behind. They don't know about the bust, it's better that way. It wants me to walk south. I will.

## 15th of Heironeium, 3021

I've walked for more than a month. My feet are bleeding, but the spirit tells me I've finally arrived. I'm convinced that it's a demon. I'm in some little shithole town called Cauldin's Point and I bought a small plot of land west of the town along the main road. The demon wants me to build an inn on this site, and I will comply. I must comply.

I've sent for my savings and resigned from my position at the university. The inn will be built fast and cheap. I'm calling the place "Jonah's Demon," hopefully it will deter people from wanting to stay there. Anyway, that's the plan.

## 30th of Heironeium, 3021

I've dug out the foundation today and found a large capstone underground. I was able to move it aside and underneat it was a narrow passage leading deeper underground. I'm not going down there. Not another tunnel. I'm just going to build the damned inn. That's it. I don't care about anything else. I'm not going down there.

## 7th of Pelorium, 3021

The inn opened today. It's named "Jonah's Demon," and the name doesn't deter anyone. Sadly, the place is a success. Why nobody has opened a tavern or an inn near this town along this busy road is a mystery to me. A girl helps me out with the day to day drudgery, I just sit in my office and listen to the demon in my head. It still wants me to go into the tunnel.

## 19th of Raoium, 3027

I finally went down the tunnel. Six years I resisted. Today I failed. I failed. I failed. I saw the door, went through using the word it told me. Amalchi. It's old. I think it's evil. I want out.

But the girl is pregnant. She says it will be a boy. I just want out.

## 24th of Lirrai, 3057

I can write words in here. Writey write. Amalchi. That's a word. Star. It's a word too. Jonah. That's my namey name. Also my son. His name too. We all have a name. He has a girl too. Mine is dead.

## 3rd of Pelorium, 3068

Demon is gone. Head empty.

Come back. Please.
