# Collapsible Spear

An unassuming cylinder of brushed metal, unadorned except for a small divet. Its origins are unknown, and its metal body is always cold to the touch. While the divet is pressed down upon, the ends of the cylinder expand to 5 feet within a fraction of a second into extremely sharp points.

While the divet is not pressed and the ends retracted, the cylinder is 2" in diameter and 3.5" tall. In this mode, it is not a weapon. This also means that the spear cannot be thrown without it immediately retracting.

While the divet is pressed, the total length of the spear is 5', with points on both ends.

The spear is magical and has a +1 bonus to attack and damage.
