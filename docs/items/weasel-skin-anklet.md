# Weasel-Skin Anklet

A tight-fitting enchanted weasel-skin leather anklet that provides **ten escapes from Opportunity Attacks** and can fit under other garments or armor.

After the anklet absorbs the ten Opportunity Attacks, it disintegrates beyond repair. The anklet cannot be repaired or recharged.
