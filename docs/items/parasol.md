# 🔐 Parasol of Opacity

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

The parasol of opacity can be put down anywhere and creates beneath it a pitch-black magical darkness. Non-magical light sources can't illuminate beneath it, and darkvision won't penetrate it. Those outside of the darkness can't see within.

The parasol creates a field of darkness 7 ft. tall, and 25 ft. in diameter. The darkness terminates at ground level and defines a hemisphere. Moving the parasol moves the hemisphere as well.
