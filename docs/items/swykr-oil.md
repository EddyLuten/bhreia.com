# Swykr Oil

Assumed to have been made by the fabled Stone Giants who inhabited the Kleftmon mountain range in Korbantir Ages ago, **Swykr Oil** is a very rare find indeed. Stored in vessels disguised as plain rocks, the oil may be applied to any weapon (magical or otherwise) and grants a **+1 bonus on attack and damage** by reducing the resistance at which the weapon is wielded.

The substance is **non-magical**, but rather a concoction of unknown ingredients, so it may be applied to a magical weapon to provide an additional bonus.

The oil may be applied before an attack as a free action. Once the weapon hits, the oil is expended from the weapon and will need to be re-applied.

There are **30 uses** per container. The substance cannot be refilled.
