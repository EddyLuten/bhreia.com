Grungine is an opioid used as a recreational drug, made from the poison present in the bodies of **Dark Grungs**, which are small froglike creatures related to the more common tropical colorful Grungs. Grungine's is known for causing deep euphoric trances, persistent lucid dreams, but most famously it's known for allowing **grung-vision**. Common side-effects include: addiction, lucid dreams, mental unraveling, and a crippling aversion to frogs.

## Lesser Grungine (AKA Grunge)

*Item, uncommon.* 10 gp per dose.

Lesser Grungine, or Grunge, is the simplest of the two Grungine variants. The process by which Grunge is made is crude and often performed by unskilled practitioners. It is cheap, addictive, and highly effective at causing a high.

After ingesting, you spend **1d6** hours under the effect of this drug.

Once recovered from the effects, roll a **DC 15 Constitution** saving throw to ensure that you have not become addicted to grungine. This DC is increased by +1 for each time grungine has been used in the past.

**Euphoric Trance.** For the duration, you are incapacitated in a euphoric state of trance and extreme focus. You cannot be awoken from this state.

**Idiot Strength.** For six hours after waking from the trance, you have +1 to any Strength checks.

**Lucid Dreams.** For 3 days after using grungine, you will experience lucid dreams that appear very meaningful and sometimes prophetic.

**Addicted.** Use grungine daily, or take **1d8** Psychic damage per day. After 30 + (1 for each time used) days of abstinence, the addiction stops. If grungine is used again, you will automatically become addicted once more.

## Superior Grungine (AKA Frog Supe)

*Item, rare.* 200 gp per dose.

Superior Grungine, or Frog Supe, is the more refined variant of Grungine. It has all of the same stats and effects as Lesser Grungine, but allows you to attempt Grung-Vision.

**Grung-Vision.** A **DC 14 Wisdom** saving throw allows you to focus on the subject you wish to observe within the same plane of existence and see for **1d20** minutes through their eyes.
