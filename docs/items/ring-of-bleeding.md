# 🔐 Ring of Bleeding

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

The ring appears as a closed loop of iron string, the thinness of a single strand of hair. Once equipped, it grips down on the finger, cutting through, and embedding itself within the epidermis. The wound never quite heals and continues bleeding while the ring is worn.

This bleeding effect may present itself in the player leaving drops of blood behind wherever they go.

While worn, the ring gives a +2 bonus to Intimidation skill checks.

The player can remove the ring by cutting it out of the finger.
