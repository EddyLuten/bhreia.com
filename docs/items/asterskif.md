# 🔐 Asterskif

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

!!! Warning
    WIP: this page is a work in progress.

An Asterskif (plural Asterskifs) is a vessel that sails air and space rather than bodies of water (though some can manage both).

Elves invented these vessels during the early Second Age after finding a natural portal from Bhreia to one of the moons. The raw materials allowing these vessels to move through space are only found off-planet.
