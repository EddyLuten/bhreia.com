Upon his death, Dagaz will leave behind his single blazing eye.

It radiates light in a radius of 25 ft.

Any creature holding the eye up to their own will be able to see any magical effect within 100 ft., without the barrier limitations of spells such as [detect magic](https://roll20.net/compendium/dnd5e/Detect%20Magic).

However, due to its divine powers, after use, the creature will go blind for ten minutes.
