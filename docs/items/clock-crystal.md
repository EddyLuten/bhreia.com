# 🔐 Clock Crystal

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

Can be found inside of the time counting box attached to a time keeping device created by [[sophia]], [[malachi]], and [[phidippus]].

## White Crystal

Does nothing but provide the timing needed to count the time passed since the rising of [[amalchi]] in [[cauldins-point]]. These were the crystals used by Malachi before he left for Marram.

## Black Crystal

**Upon touching:** DC 10 CON saving throw. On fail, take 1d20 damage, on success half of the throw.

### Purpose

The black crystals serve as a focus to connect the material and the elemental plane of air. Through the distribution of the clocks, the crystals have been spread out through the world. Once the time is right, they will be activated to begin the collision of the planes.

### As Planar Portals

These crystals can be repurposed as planar portals to the elemental plane of air.
