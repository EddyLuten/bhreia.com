# 🔐 Reenashi

--8<-- "spoiler.html"

!!! Warning
    WIP: this page is a work in progress.

Reenashi is the lunar colony founded by the Elves during the Third Age. Specifically, Reenash, sister of [[korban]], laid the colony's foundations. However, during the endless wars of the Third Age, Reenashi distanced itself from Bhreia, causing the settlement to become a thing of mythology.

However, Reenashi is a bustling place independent of the goings-on in Bhreia.
