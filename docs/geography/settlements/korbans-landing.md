!!! info
    This page may still change a bit, but is mostly complete and accurate.

Korban's Landing is a port city located on the eastern coast of [[korbantir]], bordering the Sea of Korban. It is also historically significant in that it was the first meeting place between elves and humans. Its namesake Korban sailed from Darvia and landed here, meeting the brothers Cauldin of Leikon and Donitar of Leikon. See the [[korbantir]] page for details on this event.

Currently, it serves as the most important shipping port east of the two lakes, providing access to the eastern lands and fast naval routes south. It is also an important city for migration in and out of Korbantir by neighboring countries.

## Artificial Features

Listed here are some notable constructed features in and around the city.

### Neighborhoods

While none of these neighborhoods are explicitly named, they are known to the people of Korban's Landing by these names.

**Ashwood Heights:** West of the Marisian Trail and north of Korban's way is defined by the presence of a temple of Melora and high-status mansions. A highly affluent area, still part of the city, but far away from the docks and fish market to be generally unencumbered by smells.

**The Old City:** East of the Marisian Trail and north of the Korban's Tears river including the docks, fish market, shops, and dockworker housing. This part of the city is built on top of the original settlement.

**The Haunches:** Mostly referring to the entire area south of the Korban's Tears river. Includes dockworker housing, landfills, taverns, shantytowns, stables, construction yards, and is generally defined by its excessive poverty.

### Roads

The road entering the city from the west and terminating at its center is named **Korban's Way**. The closest town west along this route is [[cauldins-point]], several days away.

The road that bisects the city and runs from north to south is named the **Marisian Trail**.

### Points of Interest

These are well-known places in the city.

1. **Grimhold Prison:** Nestled within the confines of The Haunches is the maximum security prison holding a total of 1,500 inmates. Grimhold prison serves the eastern half of Korbantir. A sister prison is located near Donitar, which serves the western half of the country. Executions are held within the gated-in area of the prison but are viewable by the public.
2. **Docks District:** Korban's Landing's famous docks district is always bustling with passengers, dock workers, and immigrants seeking a better future in Korbantir. Several shipping companies make their home along the waterfront, crammed with warehouses, taverns, and brothels to serve the insatiable desires of sailors and longshoremen.
3. **Fish Market:** The second largest fish market in Korbantir sits directly between the Marisian Trail and the coast, only beaten in size by the one in Crabpot.
4. **Temple of [[melora]]:** A large temple of [[melora]] stands at the crossing of Korban's Way and the Marisian Trail.
5. **Aldarion Unlimited Barracks:** [[au]] has a permanent presence in Korban's Landing and built an enormous barracks for their adventuring employees who constantly travel between countries.
6. **Prince Callum's Mansion:** The crown prince's youngest brother took a liking to the port city and built himself a home in the most affluent area of the city.
7. **Temple of [[dhoutr]]:** The temple of Dhoutr is located directly east of the Aldarion Unlimited barracks. Its interior is closed to the public, but the priests occasionally stage public events on their grounds.
8. **The Haunches Landfill:** Jam-packed with the nauseating refuse of fishing vessels and general town waste, the landfill central to The Haunches is surely a sight to behold and continues growing.
9. **Shipyard:** The ships built here are famous for their nimbleness on the open seas.
10. **Lighthouse:** Built on the place where the Leikon brothers were supposed to have first spotted Korban approach. Eventually a signal fire was lit here to aid Darvian sailors, and finally replaced with this lighthouse.
