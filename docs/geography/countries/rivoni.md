Rivoni (ri-voh-nee) is a coastal sovereign city-state and a peninsula dividing  the Sea of Korban and Maris' Tears. It is mostly known for its capital city, **[[rivoni-springs]]**, home to the eponymous healing springs.

## History

It is believed that the Leonin race emerged in the regions now contained within the borders of Rivoni. Artifacts found by historians near the Healing Springs suggest that at least fourteen distinct Leonin tribes simultaneously lived around the springs, likely for their healing properties. However, requests for further historical research has been denied by the current Royal family and unearthed artifacts have either been seized or destroyed.

### Leonin Genocide

While initially hosting a native majority Leonin population, Humans landed on the shores of Rivoni Springs from the west in **[[timeline|1642]]** and discovered their healing powers. Immediately recognizing the value of the resource, the less technologically advanced Leonin population was quickly suppressed and pushed from their home region into the eastern wilderness. When the Leonin resisted the human invasion, human armies were raised to exterminate any Leonin who resisted. This order still stands to the current day, though the armies have been replaced by adventurers, hunters, and mercenaries looking to make a quick buck.

### Ongoing Leonin Terrorism

Due to the historical Leonin genocide and their status within the country as a *Scourge*, the remaining Leonin have made their homes in the jungle of "The Rest" (see Geography). Desiring control of their original homeland, Leonin splinter groups occasionally cause bloodshed, destruction, and chaos in the name of this cause in [[rivoni-springs]]. These attacks are generally aimed at disrupting the spring-water-based economy, such as attacks on harbored ships and traveling trades people.

These attacks have been more frequent and more violent as of late. The royal government has stated that they believe the various Leonin tribes have banded together under a unified banner.

The original extermination orders still stand and any Leonin may be killed on sight. A Leonin pelt may fetch a bounty of 2,500 gold pieces when delivered in Rivoni Springs. The halls of the royal family are covered in these pelts as a display of power and control.

## Government

Rivoni is a monarchy, and currently ruled by **Queen Baris** of the Rivoni Royal House. Their banner, and the flag of the country, is a black Leonin head impaled by a spear upon a yellow field. The Queen is advised by an assembly of local influential citizens, though the actual influence that this council has on the governing of the royal house is debated.

### Worldwide Criticism

While much of the world relies on the healing waters from Rivoni, some countries have been critical of the actions of the royal government against the Leonin population. Most notably, emperor **Gaulian Menix** of the Abta Hatti Empire has outlawed any healing waters within their borders and ceased import and export operations entirely.

    Via proclamation, 3063

    The disgraceful Queen Baris of Rivoni continues the atrocities of her vermin ancestors. She proudly boasts of the bloodshed against the Leonin people to whom the lands she ransacks rightfully belong. She should be grateful to [[urlac]] that our glorious empire does not neighbor her miniscule fiefdom.

    Leonin people, though you may not want to leave your homeland, know you always have a second home in the glorious embrace of the Abta Hatti Empire.

    Let it be known that wilfull travel to Rivoni by any subject of the Abta Hatti Empire dissolves their citizen status and immediately marks them as an enemy combatant. Any consumption or ownership of Rivoni healing waters within the confines of the empire will be grounds for severe judgment.

    Gaulian Menix, Emperor of the glorious Abta Hatti Empire

## Geography

For a radius of a few miles outside the city in any direction, it is surrounded by countryside. There are a few smaller towns along the main roads, but the majority of the population is located in Rivoni Springs.

Most of Rivoni is composed of a vast primordial sub-tropical jungle, disparagingly named "The Rest," which goes mostly unexplored and uncharted. This stretches out from the west to the east where it eventually gives way to the foot of a desert in the East, bordering Ta√Øni.

## Demographics

While many, if not most, races are present in Rivoni due to the vast amount of tourists that the spings attract, there are a few races more represented than others in the permanent citizenry of the country:

- Human (Majority), everywhere
- [[cuniko]] (Minority), everywhere
- Genasi (Minority), in the jungles and near the desert
- Leonin (Minority *Scourges*), in the jungles and near the desert
