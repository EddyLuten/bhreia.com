!!! info
    This page may still change a bit, but is mostly complete and accurate.

Korbantir (core-ban-tier) is a sovereign country at the north-most tip of the peninsula between the five central seas of Bhreia. It is bordered by both Parlina and High Maris.

## Etymology

Korban + PIE -*ter…ô* (cross over, pass through, overcome). Meaning Korban's Crossing or the place Korban overcame (see History below).

## History

See also [[timeline]].

In the **First Age**, Korbantir was part of the Bhreia super-continent and primarily a home to a large variety of woodland creatures. Some of ancient forests still remain, but many have been cut down for timber over the years.

It wasn't until the **Second Age** that the large landmass fractured and Korbantir's shape was finalized. During this Age, the first Human settlements appeared around Korbantir's central lakes and it is thought that this area is the cradle of Humankind on Bhreia.

As humans expanded their territory along the peninsula, they came into contact with the Elves of Darvia, who had crossed the Three Brothers sea under the leadership of the Elf simply known as **Korban**. Humans and Elves made first contact at what is now known as the town of [[korbans-landing]] in 1821. The regional Human tribal leaders, **Cauldin of Leikon** and his brother, **Donitar of Leikon** welcomed the Elves into their homes and paved the way for the intermingling of Elves and Humans now so common in Korbantir. Both the country and the sea which Korban navigated are now named after him.

However, during this period, Korbantir was roughly divided into two regions, the Western half of it was named **Vesperlenda** (roughly translated, Western Land), and the Eastern half **Sunuzbern** (roughly translated Sun Born or Sun Birth).

During the **Third Age** (which was marred by war and conflict between the many races) both regions kept a relative peaceful stance. Shortly after the start oft he Third Age, the two halves joined as **Korbantir** (see Politics below). There were some border skirmishes along the southern border, but in general, the country didn't see much conflict during the Age. Many attribute this to the development of a liberal **multicultural** society, others simply due to the fact that the country was difficult to attack because of its nautical borders ringed with many cliffs and difficult to traverse terrain. During this Age, Korbantir was one of the few places to prosper and became a home for many who craved neutrality above all else.

Yet, there were those Humans who mistrusted the growing influence of outsiders and feared the erosion of Human culture in what was thought to be the birthplace of Humanity. On one evening in 2208, night fell and and the sun did not reappear for many days. The world grew colder and Korban, who was in his latter years at this point, traveled eastward from [[cauldins-point]] to [[korbans-landing]] where he was ambushed midway by a group of Humans who assassinated him. Hours after the assassination, the sun rose once more. This period of darkness is referred to as **The Many Days of Night** and still goes unexplained. The forest where he was slain is now named **Korban's Ruin**.

The assassination of Korban has lead to increased strain between the Human and Elven civilizations, though Korbantir remains a deeply integrated society into the **Fourth Age** thanks to the historical efforts of Korban.

## Politics

Korbantir is a monarchy. While Donitar and Cauldin of Leikon are seen as the founders of the country, they are not the direct progenitors of the monarchy.

For a hundred years after encountering the Elves, the country was divided into two main regions: the Western half, ruled by the descendants of Donitar of Leikon, and the Eastern half, ruled by the descendants of Cauldin of Leikon. Due to unknown reasons (though some claim a family curse), the Leikon bloodlines ran dry and eventually neither half was left with an heir. The final Leikon heir died in **2052**.

The nobles of Korbantir worked together to find a suitable replacement, but could not find one in the midst of their own bickering. They enlisted the help of Korban, who proposed a Half-Elf nobleman named **Kaylan Dranathi** whose parents were both of Darvian and West Korbantirian descendance. He proposed a marriage between Kaylan and a Half-Elf noblewoman named **Allebeth Lethson**, whose parents were of Darvian and East Korbantirian descendance.

Several nobles feared that this union would present a threatening Darvian influence and a dilution of Human influence. However, since both Kaylan and Allebeth were born and raised in Korbantir, the majority ruled in favor of the union. With their marriage, the monarchy became established in **2081** and, again with some resistance that eventually proved fruitless, they named their country Korbantir in honor of the Elf who was responsible for their unification.

This royal house, named the **House of Dranathi-Lethson** currently still rules over Korbantir.

### Royal Family

The current (3079) royal family:

- King Kaylan VI, age 89
- Queen Bexatria, age 73
  - Crown Prince Kaylan, age 52
  - Prince Callum, age 43
  - Princess Maruka, age 34
  - Princess Anjanna, age 28

Keeping with tradition, all kings have been named Kaylan and all marriages have resulted in Half-Elven offspring.
