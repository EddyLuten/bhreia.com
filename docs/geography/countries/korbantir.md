## History

See also [Timeline](../../lore/timeline.md).

In the **First Age**, Korbantir was part of the Bhreia super-continent and primarily a home to a large variety of woodland creatures. Some of ancient forests still remain, but many have been cut down for timber over the years.

It wasn't until the **Second Age** that the large landmass fractured and Korbantir's shape was finalized. During this Age, the first Human settlements appeared around Korbantir's central lakes and it is thought that this area is the crade of Humankind on Bhreia.

As humans expanded their territory along the peninsula, they came into contact with the Elves of Darvia, who had crossed the Three Brothers sea under the leadership of the Elf simply known as **Korban**. Humans and Elves made first contact at what is now known as the town of Korban's Landing in 1821. The regional Human tribal leaders, **Cauldin of Leikon** and his brother, **Donitar of Leikon** welcomed the Elves into their homes and paved the way for the intermingling of Elves and Humans now so common in Korbantir. Both the country and the sea which Korban navigated are now named after him.

During the **Third Age** (which was marred by war and conflict between the many races) Korbantir kept a relative peaceful stance. There were some border skirmishes along the southern border, but in general, the country didn't see much conflict. Many attribute this to the development of a liberal **multicultural** society, others simply due to the fact that the country was difficult to attack because of its nautical borders ringed with many cliffs and diffcult to traverse terrain. During this age, Korbantir was one of the few places to prosper and became a home for many who craved neutrality above all else.

Yet, there were those Humans who mistrusted the growing influence of outsiders and feared the erosion of Human culture in what was thought to be the birthplace of Humanity. On one evening in 2208, night fell and and the sun did not reappear for many days. The world grew colder and Korban, who was in his latter years at this point, traveled eastward from Cauldin's Point to Korban's Landing where he was ambushed midway by a group of Humans who assassinated him. Hours after the assassination, the sun rose once more. This period of darkness is referred to as **The Many Days of Night** and still goes unexplained. The forest where he was slewn is now named **Korban's Ruin**.

The assassination of Korban has lead to increased strain between the Human and Elven civilizations, though Korbantir remains a deeply integrated society into the **Fourth Age**.
