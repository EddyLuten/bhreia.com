# Silubria

**Silubria** is an island in the **Merian Sea** and a sovereign city-state ruled by a monarchy that has been in place since the [[timeline|Second Age]] of Bhreia. Outside of its borders, it's mostly known as a stop along the way while crossing the Merian Sea, a hub connecting other seaports, and for its export of silver.

## History

Silubrians claim that Elves and Humans both originated in Silubria and migrated to other lands from there. The majority of Silubria's native population is composed of Elves and Humans, though most Peoples are now present due to its busy seaports.

Silubria's prehistory is shrouded in mystery. Texts pressed into clay tablets in unknown writing systems have been found in ruins across the island and are yet to be translated. Crude paintings were found painted in charcoal and animal blood on cave walls depicting a prehistoric hunter-gatherer society of Elves and Humans. The authenticity of these paintings and text have been are widely disputed by scholars from other countries since they seem to oppose the extablished [[timeline]]. Silubrians, however, point to these artifacts as evidence of their theory that Elves and Humans originated on the island.

## Government

The royal family in Silubria is named the **House of Gajarta** after its progenitor, **Gajarta of Sarapum**, the fabled Silver Spider. Each successive heir to the throne has taken the name Gajarta and rejected their birth name, regardless of gender. The moniker of Gajarta is as much a title as it is a name.

    During [[sentinels]], the ruler in place is **Gajarta the 53rd**, a King.

    During [[dauriels-mansion]], the ruler in place is **Gajarta the 59th**, a Queen.

## Laws

The royal family and its counsels are responsible for both the creation and enforcement of the country's laws.

### Magic Use

Magic use in public settings is restricted to those with a government-issues permit. These permits are colloqioally named **Blue Shields** due to the shield-shaped metal pin that must be worn by the magic-user on their clothing at all times.

Magic use by non-permitted individuals, or individuals not displaying their Blue Shield, is severly punished.

### Freedom of Movement for Non-Residents

Non-residents of Silubria are expected to remain in Arjuna, the country's seaport city. Travel through the rest of the country is forbidden unless a visa is obtained through the local government.

## Geography

Its capital city is **Sarapum**, located on the Southern slope of **Mount Rajata**, where the main population of the island is located. However, there are several smaller settlements scattered across the island, most notably:

- Arjuna, a smally city that serves as the island's seaport
- Matha, a village built around the temple of [[angwae]] on the summit of Mt. Rajata
- Nasaha, a town built on the ruins of a previous settlement
- Khanati, a town that houses the workers of the silver mines
- Matsyah, a fishing village on the northern slope

### Mt. Rajata

Mt. Rajata is a natural anomaly in the Merian Sea. Its single peak is located in the deepest trench of the sea and yet extends higher than any mountain in a 2000 mile radius. The slopes of this single mountain peak constitute the entirity of the island's mass. Its minerals are composed of sandstone, quartz, alabaster, streaked with rich silver deposits which provides the mountain with its signature bright white appearance.

### Silver Mines

Though silver is Silubria's main export, not many have seen the fabled silver mines at Khanati. These heavily guarded mines are only accessible by miners and high level government officials. It is rumored that even though the island itself can be traversed from one end to another in little more than a day by a swift-footed traveler, the maze of mineshafts is nearly endless and would take a lifetime to explore completely.
