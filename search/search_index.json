The world's Peoples fought off Monsters, gods contested their domains, and the lands of the world fractured under it all as Bhreia tried to maintain a balance and cohesion. This terrible Age will forever be remembered as a time of great suffering for all.</p> <p>But that's the past.</p> <p>Old rivalries fizzle out, gods grow weary, and Monsters and People alike settle down, fearing extinction altogether. The flow of time's river inevitably polishes the coarsest rock into a round pebble. The Fourth Age is young, but she brings with her a tender, well-deserved, peace. But, how long until someone decides to take advantage of this tender moment? How long until the wars are forgotten and the round stone of memory is worn away entirely? Some say that the Fourth Age is the last, and that this peace is but an interlude to a final crescendo of violence.</p> <p>Ages are marked by cataclysm. Many fear that the true nature of the Fourth Age has not yet been revealed. Surely, it can't be peace? Travelers from faraway lands claim to have heard Cauda's song echoing distantly between the mountain peaks; a known herald of calamity.</p> <p>Yet, through it all, Korbantir remained steadfast and unchanged. Despite its adversarial origins, the country became a bastion of neutrality, acceptance, and prosperity. And it is in this haven that the ships of fate shall dock and our paths must converge.

Surprising even his father, the most accomplished blacksmith in Korbantir, Hanlar bent the forge to his will within months of total dedication. After only a few years and some convincing, Hanlar took over the reigns from his father who saw in him a potential business magnate who could cement their name through the ages.</p>"},{"location":"adventures/blue-skies/npcs/hanlar-ironstone/#expanding-the-forge","title":"Expanding the Forge","text":"<p>Business was good for the Ironstone Forge, but Hanlar wanted more than supplying the local militias and guards. After his arranged marriage with Ingrid Alluvium (of Alluvium mining family fame) the new infusion of the girl's dowry supplied him with enough cash to buy the lands surrounding the forge and expand his operation.</p> <p>The quality of his work became known throughout the country and word of his wares caught the ear of one Dauriel Aldarion, the leader of an upstart adventuring company. Dauriel visited the forge and after seeing the advantage of using superior Ironstone weapons, signed a contract with the Ironstone Forge, making it the sole supplier of weapons for Aldarion Unlimited.</p> <p>While this was happening, Ingrid gave birth to a baby girl named \ud83d\udd10 Sophia. Knowing that his name would not be carried on by a female heir, the couple kept trying for a male heir, but did not succeeded. Ingrid, exhausted from prematurely aborted pregnancies and tired of Hanlar's insistance on a male heir, drowned herself in the river The Wrinkle, behind the forge. Sophia was 12 years old, sole heir and now suddenly housemaker to Hanlar, who grew in desperation and fell into a depression from which he would never fully emerge.</p> <p>As Aldarion Unlimited grew, so did the forge, providing Cauldin's Point with an influx of jobs and commerce until the discovery of Grungs nearby fueled a rampant production of Grungine.</p> <p>During this time of decline for Cauldin's Point, Hanlar caught Sophia, now a young adult, and a young employee of Aldarion Unlimited named Malachi Medeid in flagrante delicto. Enraged, Hanlar threatened to disown Sophia and banished from the family and have Malachi fired from AU. While this threat worked for a little while, once Malachi had earned enough gold to secure them a place to live, Sophia left her father behind without saying goodbye. The two would never speak again.</p> <p>The forge, however, never ceased producing quality wares at the highest possible capacity.

His grandparents served the Lord of their time as did Philippe's parents, and so was Phillipe expected to do the same. Like Gadot, he owned almost nothing himself but had a childhood in which he was well cared for and taught the skills he would need to serve the Lord of his time. The Lord of the estate was kind to the servants, and Philippe had a lot of freedom around the estate. He was both a gifted acrobat and would often entertain guests at the estate. He also had a penchant for thievery. He mostly stole harmless things with no large consequence if he got caught: extra sweets, old weapons from the guard, etc.</p> <p>While still a young adult, he met Lydia. A young cuniko who was recently hired to his Lord's employ. She fell in love with his daring nature as Philippe fell for her dreams of a faraway home: Lydia and Phillipe together, no Lord, no estate.</p> <p>They conceived a child, and Gadot was then born. Philippe became determined to make their dream a reality. Days after Gadots 3rd birthday, Philippe entertained a group of his Lord's visitors. Utilizing his cunning skills, he lifted a valuable bauble from a guest.</p> <p>Seeking to sell it for a small fortune, he brought it to Donitar. The first merchant he visited, recognized the bauble as belonging to another noble family and his guards restrained Philippe.</p> <p>After questioning Philippe about how he obtained it, the merchant took pity on Philippe. He told Philippe to go home and to place the bauble somewhere inconspicuous like his Lord's room. Waiting for night, Philippe crawled up the estate and slipped through the window to his Lord's room. Philippe laid the bauble to rest in a jewelry box with the other precious items.</p> <p>Philippe told Lydia about his endeavor to better their lot in life and their ambition diminished as they realized how close Philippe came to never returning. As the weeks churned on, the three grew closer as Philippe and Lydia forgot their past ambition.</p> <p>One night, the estate was attacked. All were caught unaware. Scrambling, Philippe found an escape, but Lydia couldn't keep up. As the attackers surrounded them, Lydia tossed Gadot to Philippe before one of them plunged their sword through her. Blood pulsing, with his child in arm, Philippe tumbled around the slashing blades of the invaders before leaping for a window. Landing cleanly on the ground, Philippe silently fled the estate. Before they left the ground entirely, he saw two men atop horses outside the estate. With the brightly flickering light of their torches, he recognized the first face as his Lord's guest from whom he stole and the second as the merchant from Donitar.</p> <p>He fled to Kleftmon and worked as a burglar. His acrobatic skills and hard lessons provided him and Gadot a life, although Gadot was often watched by others in Kleftmon while Philippe was away at work. Eventually tales of his skill reached Dauriel who invited Philippe to join AU.</p>"},{"location":"adventures/blue-skies/npcs/phillipe-jdogeaux/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Blue Skies</li> <li>NPCs</li> </ul>"},{"location":"adventures/blue-skies/npcs/prince-callum/","title":"\ud83d\udd10 Prince Callum","text":"\ud83d\uded1 Spoilers Ahead! <p>             This entire page is meant as DM information.

It would be somewhat deep into the forest as he wouldn't want it easy to find but it's been lived in for so long that it stands out as a man-made structure if one is close enough. Nearby would be his tobacco and vegetable garden that is fenced and gated to keep Ramona from eating it all. The area around the shelter would be well worn from Ramona's grazing and both of them moving about. Although I suppose now it is overgrown from time's passage. Here are some images that convey what I imagine in my head. Eddy: Do you have some kind of inventory in mind? I remember you talked about taking fiddle during the first session or so Nate: I imagine more loggy than not. So he would have had some basics for harvesting and planting tobacco and root veg. Probably ate a lot of rabbit stew lol. Yeah he left the fiddle back at his house. Most of his cooking gear he had with him and was left in the cart pre-dragon attack. But the bigger stuff would be at the cabin still. I imagine a basic stone hearth and perhaps an open air lean-to for drying the tobacco leaves and storing some stuff in crates and barrels.</p>"},{"location":"adventures/blue-skies/sidequests/wolfs-house/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Blue Skies</li> <li>DM Only</li> <li>Sidequests</li> </ul>"},{"location":"adventures/dauriels-mansion/","title":"Dauriel's Mansion","text":"\ud83d\uded1 Spoilers Ahead! <p>             This entire page is meant as DM information.

He sounds nostalgic discussing all this; he seems to miss those days. One glass display case holds three items in particular that make him sad. The weapons of his fellow old-timey adventurers who died while Dauriel was able to make it out. An astute observer would be able to detect a great amount of guilt in Dauriel.</p> <p>Moreus seems oblivious to his husband\u2019s sadness (isn\u2019t actually, he just wants Dauriel to hear this) and says that he\u2019s glad he is no longer putting his life in danger.</p> <p>Dauriel looks older to everyone, much older than the last time they saw him, too old for only 462 years. Dauriel will not acknowledge this if asked about it or make up excuses.</p> <p>Passing through the hallway between rooms, the adventurers can see a large set of wooden doors, incongruous with the rest of the mansion\u2019s decor. If they ask Dauriel what it is, he will say it\u2019s just the entrance to the wine cellar. He\u2019s not lying, he did build a wine cellar there, but it\u2019s also the entrance to a dungeon that\u2019s under the house.</p> <p>After Dauriel shows them around the house (the parts he wants them to see), he fetches libations. Moreus tells the adventurers that he\u2019s found the perfect present for his husband and can\u2019t wait to show him the surprise he has planned for him. He asks them not to spoil it for him.</p> <p>People show up to the birthday party and at its climax, Moreus says he\u2019s going to be right back. The adventurers know that he\u2019s preparing his big surprise. A few minutes later, he shows back up in the room holding a glowing orb, bright green light emanates from it and the crowd moves back in awe and fear.</p> <p>\u201cDarling, I know that you miss you days of adventuring so much,\u201d he says holding the orb in front of him. \u201cAnd I want you to be able to do so. But, I just couldn\u2019t spend another moment waiting for you at home, hoping you made it out alive this time around.\u201d</p> <p>\u201cMoreus, what are you doing?\u201d Dauriel asks bewildered.</p> <p>Moreus crushes the orb in his hands and the green light begins snaking up his arms, seemingly alive. \u201cI\u2019m coming with you, darling,\u201d he says, watching the magic take place with his eyes wide open. \u201cThis will make me strong enough to withstand\u2014\u201c he stops mid-sentence as the green energy reaches his face and screams in agony. \u201cI don\u2019t understand,\u201d he says, falling onto his knees while the green energy covers his entire body. \u201cShe said that it would make me worthy,\u201d he groans.</p> <p>Dauriel drops onto his knees with him. \u201cMoreus, what have you done?\u201d</p> <p>Moreus falls down on his back, unable to speak as he\u2019s entirely engulfed in the green energy. His body lifts up off the floor and slowly moves horizontally across the floor, out the doorway, down the hallway, and - as if he were a ghost - passes through the large closed wooden double door, out of sight.</p> <p>Dauriel is inconsolable and dismisses the people at his birthday party to go back to their homes, but asks the adventurers to stay behind.</p>"},{"location":"adventures/dauriels-mansion/story-outline/#the-ask-for-help","title":"The Ask for Help","text":"<p>A distraught Dauriel takes them to his study, a room adjacent to his trophy room where he unlocks a drawer in his heavy oaken desk and retrieves a heavy iron key - used to open the heavy wooden doors through which Moreus disappeared.</p> <p>Dauriel looks around the drawer for another item and says \u201cI was afraid of this.\u201d Moreus has taken the orb.</p> <p>He explains to the adventurers that on his final adventure, he defeated a powerful entity that was inhabiting the body of a young man, Moreus. The mansion they\u2019re in now stands atop the cave entrance into the ancient subterranean complex where Dauriel defeated the entity.</p> <p>With his own magic, he was able to trap the entity\u2019s essence in an orb of powerful magic and save Moreus. Once the entity was freed from Moreus\u2019 body, he had no recollection anything that transpired before the moment he was set free. Nothing but his own name. Dauriel nursed Moreus back to health and, over time, the two fell in love. Moreus never was told that he was inhabited by the entity, he just thinks that Dauriel found him on the hill, unconscious.</p> <p>They built the mansion over the ruins that once stood on this hilltop and happily spent their lives there for many years. The orb could only be broken and the entity set free by its original host, but only willingly. Moreus and the entity were still very much connected, which meant that destroying the entity would destroy the man. And though the two of them have traveled, Dauriel has noticed that Moreus always wanted to come back home only a few days into their journeys. He fears that the location and the man are somehow inextricably linked. Dauriel fears that his magic wasn\u2019t strong enough to keep the entity from communicating with Moreus, and that it tricked him to willingly break the orb, allowing the entity to reclaim its host.</p> <p>Dauriel wants the adventurers to find a way to retrieve his beloved Moreus and do what he couldn\u2019t do himself the last time around: destroy the entity while keeping Moreus alive.</p> <p>If asked about it, he says that he can\u2019t come with them. The price he paid to entrap the entity was his own life force, which has reduced his vitality and stripped him of his magical abilities. He says that he\u2019s within the last few decades of his life - if that - but he was happy to sacrifice this for Moreus. However, though he\u2019s in no physical condition to help, he does provide the adventurers with some tools from his trophy room and information.</p> <p>He casts a spell and materializes a small white crystal sphere, which looks like a pebble. Reluctantly, he hands it to the adventurers and says to only use this in a case of extreme need. It contains his remaining life force and that he would like it back in case they don\u2019t need it, so he can spend his final days with Moreus. If they were to destroy it, Dauriel would surely die. How fast? Unknown.</p> <p>If asked about it, Dauriel says that he doesn\u2019t know Moreus\u2019 true identity. He gestures to the old tomes lined on the shelves of his study and says that he\u2019s studied them looking for a hint of Moreus or the entity, but has found nothing. If anything, he says, the answers would probably lie in the subterranean complex below the mansion where he freed Moreus from the entity, but he promised Moreus to quit adventuring, so he never returned there.</p>"},{"location":"adventures/dauriels-mansion/story-outline/#going-underground","title":"Going Underground","text":"<p>Once equipped and filled with useful information, the adventurers set down through the doors leading into the wine cellar.

Show, and don't ask again!              </p> <p>Thirty-five years before his birthday party, Dauriel Aldarion was traveling through the town of Cauldin's Point to his nearby adventuring guild west of town when he was approached by a woman who asked him for his help. Slung around her neck and supported in her arms seemed to be a child, closely cradled to her chest. She explained that she followed her husband down a cave, which lead into an underground complex. There, she saw him and four others perform a blood sacrifice around the naked body of a man.</p> <p>Dauriel followed the woman to where she entered the cave, but before he entered, he could already feel a dark and evil energy coming from within. He turned around and told the woman that he'd be back soon and went off to gather his party. Once he and his party returned, the woman was gone, but the cave was still there and radiating energy.</p> <p>Unbeknownst to him, the woman was the deity Bhreia in disguise as a human woman, trying to stop her brother \ud83d\udd10 Amalchi from doing what he was about to do.</p> <p>The party entered the cave and after a few hours breached into an underground complex, just as the woman had explained. There were old structures, much like buildings, carved into the stone. At its center was a spire that lead upward towards the surface. The party concluded that they were somewhere right underneath Cauldin's Point.</p> <p>They went up the spire and found a man inhabited by a powerful entity. The man warned them to stay away and leave him be or he would have to fight them. The party sensed the entity's strength, and everyone but Dauriel decided to leave to get backup. Dauriel felt betrayed by his party and decided to fight Amalchi alone. Amalchi laughed and struck him down hard enought to almost kill him. Near death, he knew he had only one trump card left. A type of necromancy he learned off the books while studying lichs. He would trap part of this entity's life force in an orb, but casting the spell would take a heavy toll. As he cast it, even though they were far down the spire already, his fellow party members felt their energy draining from their bodies and began running away. But it was too late. As they exited the bottom of the spire, they fell to the floor as their life force was drained. They crawled on their hands and feet as they slowly wasted away and died face down in the dirt.</p> <p>Dauriel had nearly enough life force gathered to complete his spell, but had to use some of his own to complete the spell. He focused the collective life forces of his party and himself and was able to split the conscious and unconscious parts of the entity and trap the conscious part in an orb that acted as a prison. It wasn't perfect, but it would hold the entity until Dauriel could figure out what to do with it.</p> <p>The threat was neutralized and the body of the man who was inhabited by the entity fell to the ground. Alive, but unconscious. Dauriel was weakened, but managed to bring him to the surface where he awoke. He had no memory of anything that had happened in his life with the sole exception of knowing his own name: Moreus.</p> <p>As Dauriel nursed Moreus back to health in town over many weeks, they fell in love. Dauriel decided to leave town, but when he suggested this, Moreus objected. Somehow, he felt connected to Cauldin's Point and didn't want to leave. Dauriel feared that there was some kind of physical connection keeping Moreus there. Maybe it was a side effect of the lich-inspired necromancy spell that he used. Either way, he was in love, relented, and they stayed in town.</p> <p>Over the years, they purchased the land that contained the cave leading to the subterranean complex and built a mansion on top of it. This way, Dauriel could stay closeby and monitor the strange magic that bound his now husband to this place.</p> <p>Having used much of his life force, Dauriel was forced to retire from adventuring and relinquish control of his company over to his second in command.</p>"},{"location":"adventures/dauriels-mansion/acts/act-1/dauriel-vs-amalchi/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>DM Only</li> <li>Dauriel's Mansion</li> <li>Story</li> </ul>"},{"location":"adventures/dauriels-mansion/acts/act-2/","title":"Act 2: The Party","text":"\ud83d\uded1 Spoilers Ahead! <p>             This entire page is meant as DM information.

At the spry young age of fifty-seven, he left his birth country behind and ventured into the chaotic world of humans. At first, these crude people seemed to him to be not much more than parasites, living their short lives in pursuit of material gains and fleeting fame. But over the many years, Dauriel learned to love them and appreciate their attempts, however desperate, to leave a mark upon history.</p> <p>Though, it was difficult for him to find his place in a mostly human society, which forced him to take odd jobs; those jobs that humans deemed unskilled or too dangerous.

While digging, he stumbled upon a strange onyx statue and brought it with him on his way home to Korban's Landing. However, as he set up his tent in the woods outside of the town of Cauldin's Point, the statue spoke to him in his dreams and told him to build an inn right where he lay.</p> <p>He did as he was told and opened the inn in 3021 and never went back home to Korban's Landing. Though he never knew it, the demon ordered him to build the inn atop the lost tomb of Cauldin of Leikon, capped by a large round stone, part of which is visible in the basement. Jonah hired people to run his inn and spent his days in his office upstairs talking to the statue and writing down the transcripts. If asked what he was doing, he answered \"that's between me and my demon.\" Thus, soon, the place became known as Jonah's Demon Inn. When he passed away in his old age, the onyx statue made its way downstairs and currently sits on a shelf behind the bar, nestled between some bottles. However, Jonah's writings have never been found.</p> <p>He did find time to procreate and find a wife, though there are some who argue that his demon ordered him to do so. His son, Junior Feldspar, was born in 3028 and took over the business when he was old enough.</p> DM: Basement Layout <ul> <li>One large room, filled with supplies.</li> <li>A movable round (DC 20, Strength) natural stone on the floor, hiding the entrance to \ud83d\udd10 Cauldin's Tomb.</li> </ul> DM: First Floor Layout <p> Amalchi Plaque      Amalchi's name engraved in old-common onto a plaque.    </p> <ul> <li>Common room with bar</li> <li>Back room and storage</li> <li>Kitchen</li> <li>Private sitting room<ul> <li>Only for Dauriel Aldarion's associates</li> <li>Kept on a retrainer</li> </ul> </li> </ul> DM: First Floor Items <ul> <li>On a shelf behind the bar: an onyx statue containing the soul of a demon.

They have not seen anything of the world outside of Cauldin's Point and Tino is desperate to make something of the time that they have left. With enough potions, they will leave Cauldin's Point and set out for a trip to Korban's Landing where they will board a ship to Rivoni Springs and hope for a chance to enter the famous healing springs.</p> <p>Where: A shipment of Potions of Healing is coming from Korban's Landing and is headed to Aldarion Unlimited headquarters in Donitar. As per usual, the wagon transporting the goods is protected by two guards on horseback and a single driver. The group will stop at Jonah's Denn and rotate their watch over the cargo as each group member rests for the night.</p> <p>When: The wagon will roll into the town tonight.

That's never more true when love is forbidden. The romantic story, between a highly intelligent wizard and a blacksmith, strong of arm and wit, is the tale that preceded Tiran Medeid. Tiran grew up caught between two worlds. Half of the family came from a long line of humans living in high towers filled with tomes and poured over knowledge with fierce hunger. The other half of his lineage found were far more comfortable in the sweltering heat of a blast furnace, hammer in hand crafting some of the finest weapons and armor of the realms.</p> <p>His mother Sophia Ironstone had an eye for imperfections and created some of the sharpest and strongest blades. Many of the bravest and strongest fighters tried to win over her heart but legend had it that she her heart beat as strong as her hammer and the fires of she was around had tempered it harder than the steel she worked as such she worked the forge until past her prime and the layer of soot would be the only thing that covered her marriage finger.</p> <p>That was until she met Malachi Medeid. A younger man, small of frame but large of heart and mind. Malachi who was raised in cloistered warehouses filled with bound pages of timeless wisdom began to dream of more. He read of great adventures and the people that had them. Those that forged great paths in history, turned the tides of battles and civilizations. Having an innate ability to comprehend magic he decided to make a life beyond the stone walls much to the chagrin of his parents. He traveled far and wide, studying under wizards of lands far away. As he became more adept he was approached by Dauriel Aldarion and his league of adventures at Aldarion Unlimited.</p> <p>Of course Dauriel needed to outfit his company and so he sourced weapons and armor from the Ironstone smiths. Who, for nearly a century, never disappointed. While on a contract and adventuring party of which Malachi was a part needed to outfit and so they graced the doorway of the Ironstone smiths. This was the first time Malachi saw the imposing figure and fiery hair of Sophia and he was quite enamored. However, he assumed her tastes were for that of a similar build to her, until the advances of the warriors in the party were quenched as quickly as hot iron in the cool spring water. Over the next years he would find excuses to return, and Sophia would listen to tell of grand stories, of ancient fables, and to word of recent tales that would likely become myth and legends throughout the world. It was Malachi's knowledge, humility and wide eyed excitement of the world that eased the beating of Sophia's sledgehammer heart and stoked a much different fire inside.</p> <p>One fateful evening, while snow was still on the ground and Sophia and Malachi sat in the shop, bodies warmed by the forge, hearts warmed by each other, the door to the shop burst open. The imposing figure encompassed the entire opening of the door so thoroughly that the wind could barely squeeze snowflakes in the space between him and the door jam. The father of Sophia, patriarch of the Ironstone family stepped in. He absolutely forbade the two of them to be together. He went on berating Sophia, that it would be better for her to spend decades alone than with someone who couldn\u2019t swing a hammer. He ran Malachi out of the shop and threatened his life and reputation. If Malachi continued to see Sophia then Hanlar Ironstone would use his family's close relationship and influence with Dauriel and have Malachi ejected from AU.</p> <p>Over the next months Sophia would sparsely receive letters from Malachi. Some days her forge would burn hot with anger at her father, other days her arm sluggish from the weight of love unfulfilled. Seasons came and went until finally, late one evening there was a rapping on the door. As Sophia opened it, exasperated as the nerve of whoever wanted to disturb a smith in the evening, with a defence ready of why they would need to return tomorrow. Standing on the ground, finally dry from the melting of the previous winter's snow, stood Malachi. He had earned enough coin to buy them a hamlet and enough reputation that he didn\u2019t require AU. Sophia without hesitation, irons still in the fire, pulled off her apron, wiped the layer of ash and grime, now marred with tears of joy from her cheeks. She closed the door behind her and didn\u2019t look back.</p> <p>They built a home together near the town of Basford, far from the reach of the Ironstone family. It was the perfect amalgamation of their lives. A small wooden cottage near a lake, nestled between a stone tower which began to fill with books and knowledge flowed to any who would seek it and a large shop centered around a large kiln which was field with the ring of metal against metal and billowed clouds of smoke. Providing everything from weapons, and tools to the surrounding villages and anchors, rivets, and fasteners for the nearby seas.</p> <p>It was in this environment that Tiran was raised. He learned of magic from his father, and craftsmanship from his mother. As a child his brain swirled with visions and dreams of marrying the two disciplines much as the story of his parents. Any time an adventurer came to visit whether it was to rekindle a friendship with his father or get gear from his mother, he wouldn\u2019t let them leave without showing him their technique and spending time practicing with him in the training ground he had built out back. His desire to learn and excitement for the world matched his fathers, and his hands for crafting were strong and seasoned like his mothers. He loved his life but did dream of the world beyond his hamlet and the stories he heard only kindled the passion for adventure.</p> <p>As Tiran entered neared adulthood, he desired to experiment more with the commixture of magic and metal though it was scene as near heresy for his mom and incomprehensible to his father, as only few books were ever penned by dwarven smiths on the matter and most of the weapons of renown he had encountered were typically blessed by some deity or another. If he truly wanted to master that craft he would have to find that knowledge someplace else. Two decades since the last time Sophia had heard from any of her kin, ostracised due to her choices, the Medeid family received a letter from an old acquaintance.  Aldurian penned a letter, fondly greeting Malachi and hoping to find him well and letting Sophia know that his business acquaintance, her father had passed and not one smith had been able to replicate the level of quality of the Ironstone family and if she so desired he would like to continue this partnership with her. Though, She was happy with her life and the surrounding settlements needed her here as much as she desired to stay.</p> <p>As they talked over dinner Tiran expressed his interest in starting his own smithy, his own career, his own adventure. After talking for quite some time and knowing the head and heart of the lad they sent word back to Daurien that they would be sending the combined knowledge and experience of the Medeid family, along with a cache of abundance of goods to tide AU over until such a time as Tiran could get a smithy up and running.</p> <p>Tiran and Sophia worked tirelessly for months. Crafting weapons and armor. Finally, Tiran climbed aboard a laden cart waved goodbye to his beaming parents and set wheels into motion towards Cauldin\u2019s point and his destiny</p> DM: Family Info <p>Tiran lives in Basford with his mom and dad, who both have a history with Aldarion Unlimited.</p> <ul> <li>Mother: Sophia Ironstone<ul> <li>Blacksmith</li> <li>Ostracized from her family, hasn't spoke with her kin in 20 years</li> <li>Father: Hanlar Ironstone<ul> <li>Forbade Malachi and Sophia's relationship<ul> <li>Because Malachi is not a smith</li> </ul> </li> <li>Had a close relationship with Dauriel Aldarion</li> <li>Runs the Ironstone smiths</li> <li>Supplied weapons to Aldarion Unlimited</li> <li>Died recently</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Father: Malachi Medeid<ul> <li>Magic user</li> <li>Younger than Sophia</li> <li>Worked for Aldarion Unlimited, recruited by Dauriel himself</li> </ul> </li> <li>Horse: Percheron</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/characters/tiran-medeid/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Braving Bhreia</li> <li>Characters</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/characters/wolf/","title":"Wolf","text":"Baern \"Wolf\" Mountbrew      Wolf's token in Foundry.    <p>Campaign: Braving Bhreia</p> <p>Played By: Nate</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/characters/wolf/#bio","title":"Bio","text":"<p>(Written by Nate)</p> <p>Wolf was born to the Mountainbrew clan and given the name Baern Mountbrew. The surname Mountbrew is given to unwed clansmen only to be titled Mountainbrew upon marriage. The clan is famous for their dwarven spirits, the most famous being their namesake Mountainbrew; lovingly called Mt. Brew by those outside the clan.</p> <p>Many of the dwarven clans are stubornly steeped in tradition and loathe to change for any reason. Those who buck tradition or dishonor their clan are ostracized and stripped of their name until amends can be made, to be determined by the clans elders.</p> <p>Such was the fate of Baern Mountbrew. Baern was always a bit rebelious and considered a troublemaker in his youth. While he could see the value in tradition he didn't feel connected to his clan's heritage. Baern didn't care for the taste or effects of alcohol but enjoyed the aroma and hit of good tobacco. He focused his studdies and experiments on tobacco rather than brewing and fermentation.</p> <p>This put Baern on a path of consequences like ripples in a puddle. He began to feel alienated which led him to animosity towards his clan. This clashing exacerbated until he had reached full maturity and yet had no prospects for marriage. This alone normally wouldn't be enough to kick Baern out of the clan but war was brewing on the edges of his homeland and tensions were high. It was his duty to mary and have children to carry on the tradition of their namesake.</p> <p>So Baern Mountbrew was exiled until he can forego his foolish hobby and settle down. He left his clan and name behind and became Wolf. Wolf now resides in Korban's Ruin on Korbantir where he grows tobacco to experiement with and acts as guide and tracker for those needing help in the wilds.</p> <p>For over fifty years Wolf has persued his passion finding a love for good cigars. This led to a chance encounter with none other than the now retired but famous adventurer, Dauriel Aldarion and his husband Moreus. They too were cigar enthusiasts and soon enough Wolf would find himself \"in the area\" every few years to share his latest blend with the pair. Eventually the couple requested assistance from Wolf in starting a garden due to his botany knowledge.</p> <p>Recently Wolf received an invitation to attend a birthday celebration for Dauriel in Cauldin's Point for which he has no intention on missing.</p> DM: Observations <p>Is 127 years old.</p> <p>Was named Wolf by Dauriel Aldarion.</p> <p>Owns a giant goat named Ramona -- named after an old friend.</p> <p>Has a desire to vist the Feywild.</p> <p>As of level 2, Wolf is a spellcaster, his abilities were granted to him by Bhreia.</p> <p>As of level 3, he has chosen the Horizon Walker archetype:</p> <p>Horizon Walker</p> <p>Horizon walkers guard the world against threats that originate from other planes or that seek to ravage the mortal realm with otherworldly magic.

The rememberer strides on horseback between giant rib bones into which the citizens carved their myriad dwellings. Randomly placed market stalls and innumerable people slow the horse down to a walk. High above, climbing the protruding ribs, city workers span large sheets of red fabric to provide much-needed shade from the relentless sun.</p> <p>Woven into the crowd are dozens of Orcs on a pilgrimage to collect chips of holy bone -- proof that their god once walked with them in this world. The once fearsome race now roams the continent in search of a sign of better days.</p> <p>Outside of the city's bustle, the rememberer traverses the wilderness along the shores of the oasis. He sees the Spear of Gruumsh standing tall at the lake's center - its Age-old untarnished tip glints hundreds of feet above the desert floor. Still tightly gripping the spear's shaft is the hollowed-out skeletal hand of Gruumsh, which now serves as the walls of the ruler's palace.</p> <p>Finally, he remembers the doorstep through which he set out on his adventure months ago and the strange events leading up to his departure. He remembers the tea he drank on the floor of his parent's home as his long-lost uncle Malachi told him a tale that would seal his fate.

The horse ran off into the distance, leaving the two to move their cargo off the road and take shelter from the storm.</p> <p>Wolf and Sah-Sauj arrived at Jonah's Denn during the height of this storm and found Tiran's horse hiding under the building's overhang. They stabled both their own animal and the horse and made their way inside. Upon showing their invitations, they were escorted to a private room where they rested.</p> <p>The storm petered out, and after hiding their cargo under camouflage of bushes, Tiran and Gadot set out on the road to Cauldin's Point. They also arrived at Jonah's Denn where they met up with Wolf and Sah-Sauj in the private room after also displaying their invitations to the innkeep.</p> <p>While they were all present in the room, a half-goat-half-man bard entered and sang them a strange song. Though, after the song finished, the bard disappeared into thin air, along with the door he entered the room through.</p> <p>Tiran, upon finding out that Sah-Sauj had found his horse, together with Gadot, mounted their horse and set out to collect their cargo. They did so successfully, and after a few hours made their way back to the inn where they set off to their bed chambers.</p> <p>It is here that the game ends, right before they set off for bed.

Though, for the gods, these consequences are often felt most by those below them. Bhreia fractured 1000 years ago due to one of these consequences, initiating an Age of war.

Untouched by wars, neutral in its position, and a haven for all. But, this Age is young and remains undefined.

Suspended from five glass tubes pumping blood into his body, his skin cracking, and eyes glowing, there sure did seem to be something wrong with Dauriel's husband. After trying to deceive Phidippus, a battle ensued. And for a moment, you seemed to be overtaking the old man, but once he cast invisibility on himself, no more blows were delivered. Pasha and Wolf both worked together to destroy one of the blood tubes, but Moreus' situation only seemed to be getting worse.

However, you were able to overhear a conversation between a man and a woman, discussing things you couldn't make much sense of. They seemed to be disagreeing about something, and before you knew it you were back in the blue void.</p> <p>This time, the void was cracked all around you and you felt a slight draft coming from a larger crack. You all huddled up together, and with the same method as before, Tiran propelled you towards the crack, and for the last time, you were transported.</p> <p>You arrived together on a small isle in the middle of a lake. The lake was cluttered with the debris of buildings and the isle itself had a few surprises of its own. A strange female corpse, a device of unknown purpose, and a black metal construct, which seemed to be missing some parts. You found a rowboat and decided to take off when an older and taller Mike Truk called out to you and provided you with a little bit of information.

He brought you through the tunnel system to his cave where the half Orc boy Hurq was cooking up some turkey stew and smiled as he saw you enter the cave.</p> <p>And that's where we left off.</p> DM: Session Beats <ul> <li>Rhea runs, calls \ud83d\udd10 Phidippus<ul> <li>DEX checks to overtake her in the spire</li> <li>Phidippus will not come, he's busy</li> <li>Rhea is crying throughout the whole battle, but can't stop</li> <li>Her curse is making her fight</li> </ul> </li> <li>They make it up the spire<ul> <li>They find Dauriel's old crew</li> <li>petrified in obsidian stone</li> <li>terrified looks</li> </ul> </li> <li>They enter the chamber atop the spire<ul> <li>Five glass tubes come from the ceiling, feeding blood into Moreus</li> <li>A robed man is cutting a Macoyii, feeding its blood to Moreus</li> <li>Rhea stopped?<ul> <li>True: Phidippus will be surprised</li> <li>False: Phidippus will be ready for them</li> </ul> </li> <li>Phidippus:<ul> <li>Seeing Tiran: \"You look like you must be the Ironstone boy.\"</li> <li>Seeing Pasha: \"I see that Borlok brought the right one.\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Amalchi is already inhabiting Moreus, almost done<ul> <li>Moreus' skin is breaking, pure blue light beams from the cracks</li> <li>If they decide to touch him:<ul> <li>DC 18 CON saving throw</li> <li>1d6 damage</li> <li>becomes stunned until their next turn</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Phidippus begins to defend Amalchi<ul> <li>Calls to Rhea to stand her ground</li> <li>Rhea runs, but Phidippus kills her</li> <li>FIGHT Phidippus<ul> <li>He will focus on Pasha</li> <li>He will drop:<ul> <li>a keyring with two keys:<ul> <li>one to his place</li> <li>one to the forge</li> </ul> </li> <li>a light blue robe</li> <li>two golden daggers</li> <li>boots of striding and springing</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>After he dies, Amalchi will rise regardless (flavor below)<ul> <li>Moreus bursts into pieces, disintegrating</li> <li>Amalchi's final dragon form emerges (Adult Blue Dragon)</li> <li>Its skin surges with electric charges.</li> <li>Light blue wings flap</li> <li>Envelopes players</li> </ul> </li> <li>Transported to the blue void for the first time</li> <li>Transported to the office setting</li> <li>Transported to the blue void again</li> <li>Transported back to Bhreia, at the bottom of the pit</li> </ul> DM: Amalchi Rising <p>Before you, Moreus' body streaks with coarse veins of electric energy until it can take no more.

Distantly, you noticed two figures pulling a body from the water and take it to the survivors camp south-west of the crater.</p> <p>After Hurq and Mike fetched their stew, and loaded it into a cart, you all went over to the survivors' camp where you saw a bulletin board with the names of the missing and the dead. Amongst them, Tiran, with a note that his mother was looking for him.</p> <p>Heading into the camp, a man wearing an Aldarion Unlimited uniform standing on a small podium was trying to calm down a crowd of rowdy people. He told them that there wasn't much he could do since the local government decided that they should now focus on rebuilding the town instead of finding survivors.</p> <p>After the speech concluded and the crowd dispersed, you noticed a strange time keeping device near the podium. It resembled a clock, but it also had a timer, seemingly counting days, minutes, and hours since an event. You later found out that this was counting the time since the sun had stopped moving in the sky, the exact moment when Amalchi ascended.</p> <p>Approaching you on crutches and encrusted with black obsidian crystals, you saw Londrina who recognized Sah-Sauj as a cleric of Brother and connected him showing up with the unleashing of the deity a year before. She immediately went over to Captain Weslan Stillwater, who is in charge of the camp, the same man who spoke to the crowd earlier.</p> <p>After introductions, some convincing, and explanation, Weslan was persuaded that you weren't a threat and Wolf told Londrina to get lost. He mentioned that Tiran's mom, Sophia, was waiting for him at the Ironstone Forge, which she was able to reacquire. Also, he said that he met Phillipe in Marram. Though, he should have been back in Korbantir by now.</p> <p>Weslan also asked about the events surrounding Dauriel's party and you told him everything. He bought the dagger and cloak you got off Borlok's body for 50 gold, and said he was going to look into more details about this stuff. He also mentioned that if you needed more money, he had a gig for you involving eviction.</p> <p>On your way out of the camp to the forge, you ran into an annoying Halfling man, leading a group of disaster tourists around the crater in a cart pulled by a giant goat. The goat immediately recognized Wolf, and after a quick, but brutal confrontation involving a cigar being extinguished on the halfling's forehead, Ramona was reunited with her rightful owner.</p> <p>On the road to the forge, you ran into a familiar situation. There was a tree blocking the road and one of the men who had robbed Wolf on the first night in town came staggering drunkenly from the woods, holding a hand crossbow in one hand and a bottle of booze in the other. After accidentally firing a bolt towards you, he began reloading, but never finished. Sah-Sauj smacked the man unconscious and you all robbed him of his belongings except for his glasses and hat. You continued to the forge and left him soiling himself in the middle of the road.</p> <p>Arriving at the forge, the fence surrounding it was locked shut and there was a painted sign proclaimed that it was closed for private business. After deliberating to climb the fence or pick the lock, Gadot picked the lock so expertly that it practically dismantled itself in his hands.</p> <p>You met Sophia, Tiran's mother, as well as a man named Agorius who was helping her create the time keeping devices you noticed in the camp. After she took you to the house on the property, she caught you up on why Tiran's father wasn't present. He also spoke with Weslan and became worried about Phillipe. He and a Tabaxi woman set off for Marram a few months ago to try and find Phillipe. Sophia also hasn't heard anything from her husband since.</p> <p>On the mantle in the living room, you noticed a piece of a glass tube, the same kind that fed blood into Moreus. Sophia told you that one of the forge buildings was converted into a glass furnace, which is where she found pieces of this tubing. A portrait of her, her mother, and father was also missing from the wall, likely disposed of while Phidippus owned the forge. Though, she said nothing else like that was missing from the house.</p> <p>Currently, you're getting ready to go to bed even though the sun is shining outside, which seems to be the new norm. Wolf and Sah-Sauj plan to sleep outside, Tiran and Gadot will share the guest bed, and Pasha is taking the couch in Hanlar Ironstone's old office.</p> <p>This is where we left off.</p> DM Intro <p>For the last hour or so you've been enjoying Hurq's turkey stew in the boys' cave and it honestly tastes pretty good. Though, you're not entirely sure if the chunks of meat are actually turkey, as he claims.</p> <p>While you ate, the boys caught you up on what happened during the time you were away. The blue dragon rose from the center of town, and destroyed it entirely on its way out. It seemed to take a special interest in obliterating Dauriel's mansion. A thousand people are dead or missing and a camp has been set up south-west of town that houses both survivors as well as family members waiting to hear anything about their loved ones. Every day, bodies have been pulled from the crater where Cauldin's Point used to be, though fewer lately (\ud83d\udd10 Cauldin's Point Crater).</p> <p>Hurq tells you that when you're ready, he'll take you to a spot where you can properly see what happened.</p> DM Flavor <p>Adapted from \ud83d\udd10 Cauldin's Point Crater.</p> <p>Piles of rubble emerge from the calm surface of the water that fills the crater before you. One of the oldest and most historically significant places in Korbantir now lies broken at the bottom of a water filled hole, overgrowing with plantlife which thrives in this age of perpetual sunshine.</p> <p>You can clearly tell that during his ascension through the bowels of the town, Amalchi made a point of making an example of those who dared to exist in his path. The level of destruction didn't nearly have to be this extensive. Innocent or guilty, old or young, nobody was spared the wrathful fury of this deity.</p> <p>To the west, you see a group of people pull something from the water onto a shallow beach. \"They found another one,\" says Mike. \"I wonder if any of us knew them.\"</p> <p>So much destruction. So much death. But, signs of life remain. In the south-west, against the edge of the ancient forest you see plumes of smoke trail into the bright sky from what you assume to be the survivors camp that the boys had mentioned.</p> <p>\"Do you want to go back?\" Asks Hurq.</p> Danger <ul> <li>Survivors Camp</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Ironstone Forge</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-11/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-12/","title":"Session 12: You Got Served","text":"<p>Date: Wednesday, March 2, 2022 @ 9:00 PM CT</p> <p>Audio: MP3 (2h27m)</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-12/#synopsis","title":"Synopsis","text":"<p>Before heading off to bed, Pasha found a newspaper clipping in Hanlar Ironstone's office where he went to sleep for the night. It mentioned that a decade ago, Tiran's grandfather got into a bar fight with Phidippus and disrobed him entirely, causing Phidippus to flee in shame. Pasha presented the clipping at breakfast.</p> <p>After some banter, eating breakfast, loading up on supplies, and chatting with Sophia, you decided to go back to the crater to fetch the construct that Tiran had noticed and wanted to fix up. You formulated a plan to turn Sophia's cart into a raft of some kind and maybe enlist Agorius' help to lift the construct onto it. He agreed after resting for an hour and you left after some uncomfortable hugs.</p> <p>Once you arrived, you approached the lake near the survivors' camp to look for Percheron, but the horse remained elusive. You launched the raft and boarded it, while Sah-Sauj pushed it across the lake. However, once you arrived at the island where the construct was located, one of the rain barrels that served as the raft's flotation devices crashed beyond repair upon the rocky shore.</p> <p>The construct still lay where you first spotted it and when Tiran examined it closely, he was able to find a small panel containing a mess of wires, a paper pamphlet, and a button. When pushing the button, the construct mentioned something about \"systems damaged\" and \"major systems failure,\" but not much more than that. Tiran concluded that he needed more time to look at the thing, but not on the island. After some heavy lifting by the entire group, you were able to hoist the thing onto the raft.</p> <p>But there was still the issue of the broken pontoon. Tiran mentioned that he could fell a tree and use it as an improvised replacement, but the growth on the island was too new to yield trees.</p> <p>However, Sah-Sauj spotted a log at the bottom of a waterfall leading into the crater, and retrieved it with great difficulty. The log was fashioned into a makeshift pontoon and you were on your way back to the shore.</p> <p>There, you were greeted by a group of Aldarion Unlimited bruisers lead by Weslan Stillwater and Burron Piquette, the Halfling who Wolf had taken Ramona back from the day before. Weslan served Wolf a summons to appear before a magistrate the next day and defend his case with ample evidence. Weslan Stillwater said he would vouch for him as much as possible, but the magistrate would be fair and impartial regardless.</p> <p>On the road back to the Ironstone Forge, Wolf pulled Tiran aside and told him that he was thinking about going home and ditching the trial altogether since he didn't have any ownership papers for Ramona. Especially if no plan could be devised to deal with the issue. He gave Tiran the directions to his house just in case he did decide to leave in the night.</p> <p>As you all chatted and carried on down the road, you heard the sound of wings thrashing through the air, the tops of trees breaking, followed by a juvenile one-eyed Dragon landing before Agorius and telling him something Draconian that only Pasha and Sah-Sauj could understand. After that, the creature snapped its head to Pasha and said two words directly to him right before opening its mouth and lunging directly towards him.</p> <p>Everybody, please roll for initiative.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-12/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-13/","title":"Session 13: A Dragon Appears","text":"<p>Date: Tuesday, March 8, 2022 @ 9:00 PM CT</p> <p>Audio: MP3 (3h2m)</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-13/#synopsis","title":"Synopsis","text":"<p>The game began with a battle.</p> <p>Before the juvenile blue dragon could attack, Pasha cast a spell on it, blinding the creature. Gadot and Wolf both missed their first shots. Sah-Sauj cast Shield on Pasha, Wolf, and themselves, preparing for damage. The dragon opened its maw and blasted Pasha with pure blue lightning, but he shrugged most of it off, being resistant to that type of damage. Tiran pulled out his gun and critically shot the dragon with a powerful shot. Meanwhile, Pasha made his way to Agorius, who lay unconscious by the side of the road. His eyes were closed, but Pasha couldn't quite make out what was wrong with him. However, when he touched Agorius, his skin didn't quite feel the way it should have.</p> <p>Gadot missed another one of his short-bow shots, but Wolf was able to hit the dragon with a crossbow bolt. The creature looked surprised at the amount of resistance it received, especially when Sah-Sauj cast Bane on it right afterwards. It seemed frustrated, and when Sah-Sauj taunted it out loud, it attacked them, but missed both of his attacks. Pasha and Gadot both miss their attacks, but Wolf once more was able to connect his shot, sending a fountain of blood gushing from the creature's neck. Sah-Sauj attempted to stab it with their spear, but missed, and cowered behind their shield.</p> <p>The dragon shook off its blindness and noticed that it had barely made a dent. Sensing its immediate demise, it took one final look at Agorius and Pasha, sprung up into the air, dodged your attacks, and flew away, raining blood over the entire area.</p> <p>After the battle, Pasha said that Agorius knows where to go. Pasha said that the dragon told Agorius to finish up his business here and head East. Wolf cast a spell to track dragons, ensuring that it wouldn't make a surprise return. Gadot picked up some of the dragon's blood in order to be able to track it at a later point. You decided to load Agorius onto the wagon and head back to the Ironstone Forge to talk to Sophia.</p> <p>When you arrived, you took the construct out of the wagon and moved it into a forge building. Here, you didn't see Sophia and the furnace wasn't burning, but smoke rose from the chimney of the main house. You took the still unconscious Agorius there, and when you entered, Sophia appears from her father's old office. She mentioned that Agorius slept in the cafeteria building where he had set up his mattress.</p> <p>Pasha and Sah-Sauj took him there and laid him down on his mattress on the floor of the building. You waited around for him to wake up and noticed his stash of personal effects. Sah-Sauj opened his bag, which contained a component pouch used for spells, a chunk of obsidian, a golden necklace with the initials H&amp;I inscribed on it, a blue cloak, and a golden dagger.</p> <p>Pasha silently motioned to Sah-Sauj to put the stuff back in the bag after seeing it. They tied him up, and Pasha felt the stangeness of Agorius' skin again. Sah-Sauj took a close look at Agorius' hands and noticed two things: a very strong active magical aura and that he was using a spell to disguise himself. Pasha told Sah-Sauj to run and get the others.</p> <p>When Sah-Sauj left the room, Agorius' eyes opened and he looked directly at Pasha. He said \"I didn't mean for this to happen just yet,\" then dropped his disguise spell, and revealed himself to be Phidippus. Pasha attempted to cast Hold Person, but Phidippus easily shrugged it off. He looked confident, and seemed to be struggling with something behind his back. He told Pasha that he's different and special in more ways than he knew. He also told him that he was supposed to be the sacrifice that night one year ago.</p> <p>Pasha decided to drag him out of the cafeteria and outside towards the others while he was still tied up. When he opened the door while holding Phidippus, the wizard broke his restraints, looked over his shoulder, smiled, went invisible, and a moment later, Pasha no longer sensed him in his hands. Pasha immediately used his breath weapon, but didn't seem to hit anything.</p> <p>Inside, the others heard the sonic boom and ran outside towards Pasha who explained what happened and showed everyone Phidippus's bag. Everyone searched for Phidippus, but he appeared gone. Tiran confronted his mother about Agorius, but she said that she didn't notice anything off about his behavior. He just seemed happy to help her out in constructing the clocks which they've been sending all over the world.</p> <p>Sah-Sauj used a spell to detect magic, but didn't notice anything magical outside. However, inside the forge building, they noticed a strong magical aura around the box part of the clock. Sah-Sauj asked Sophia about the obsidian they found in Phidippus' bag and Sophia told them that the stone is common in the bodies of survivors who came in contact with Amalchi.</p> <p>Tiran decided to open the box on the clock in order to take a look at what was inside. However, all he managed to do was bang a couple of dents into it. Thankfully, Sophia was available to open it up fairly easily, knowing the ins and outs of the thing she built herself. Inside of it you saw a metal spiderweb-like construction converging at an obsidian stone, glowing blue and vibrating at a high frequency. Sophia immediately noticed that this wasn't what the crystal normally looks like when they put the clocks together; it's supposed to be white, like a quartz stone.</p> <p>Tiran pulled the stone out and felt it vibrating in his hand, and it hurt quite a bit. But it felt familiar, similar to how the energy felt inside of the blue void that you were trapped in.</p> <p>Pasha asked for the stone, and the moment he touched it, had a sensation of being elsewhere, flying through the sky above a cloud covered jungle. Without being in control, he slowly descended through the jungle canopy until he found himself flying above the jungle floor and eventually following a path through this seemingly ancient jungle. Eventually, he came across a cliff bisecting the jungle, following the path along it. Until he came across Amalchi, standing on the cliff edge who told him he wasn't supposed to be there and tossed him off the cliff. Once he pierced the fog below, he found himself flying again.</p> <p>Everyone else simply saw Pasha stand in the middle of the room, slack-jawed, wide-eyed, and unresponsive. Tiran grabbed the stone from Pasha's hand and immediately got hurt again, but Pasha seemed to be back, at least. Pasha relayed the dream to everyone and Gadot told him that he had a similar dream recently. Gadot, hoping to retrigger the dream, grabbed the stone from Tiran, but to him, the stone just hurt.</p> <p>Pasha concluded that Phidippus must still have some answers to his questions and believed him to still be around the forge somewhere. However, everybody was quite messed up from the battle and from touching the stone, and you all decided to rest for a while.</p> <p>Tiran wanted to work on the construct a bit. He looked inside, and found some disconnected connectors. He plugged them in and pushed the button again. This time, the construct said \"missing system disk, please insert the disk labeled operating system.\"</p> <p>Thinking he must have missed it on the island, Tiran decided to head back and look for it there tonight. Or maybe to ask Mike and Hurq if they noticed any strange disks laying around. Sah-Sauj wrapped the stone from the clock in the lab coat they had found and put it in Borlok's bag of holding.</p> <p>And that's where we left off.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-13/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-14/","title":"Session 14: Forge Goat's Sake","text":"<p>Date: Tuesday, March 16, 2022 @ 9:00 PM CT</p> <p>Audio: MP3 (1h39m)</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-14/#synopsis","title":"Synopsis","text":"<p>Before anything could happen, Sah-Sauj needed to take a few hours to rest and sleep off their exhaustion.</p> <p>While they did so, Tiran talked to his mom, who felt depressed by Agorius' betrayal and the realization that she would once again be alone once Tiran left. She also worried about the clocks, which didn't seem to be what they first appeared to be, and her complicity in constructing them. They talked for a while and eventually she made peace with the idea of Tiran leaving to find his father. But, she needed one more favor before he set off. She asked him to open the chest in her father's old office.</p> <p>Tiran agreed and asked Pasha to come with him into the office. He explained to him that his mother doesn't like being in this office due to the strained relationship she had with her father, who pushed her mother to suicide when she was a child.</p> <p>When looking around the office, Tiran noticed that the framed newspaper article that Pasha brought to breakfast now lay shattered on the floor, the newspaper article itself torn to shreds. There were also signs of an unskilled attempt to unlock the chest.</p> <p>Realizing this was another Ironstone designed lock, Tiran enlisted the help of Gadot, who attempted to pick the lock, but failed on his first attempt. Seeing that this lock was of a superior design to the gate lock, he took his time with this one.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Tiran searched the office for a key, but failing to find it, asked his mother. She provided him with all of the keys she had, though none of them fit. However, after this interruption, Gadot was able to pick the lock and open the chest.</p> <p>Inside, he found a large bag filled with 1,500 gold pieces, lots of business paperwork, deeds to horses long gone, a stack of letters from Dauriel to Hanlar, and a sealed personal letter addressed to Sophia. This final letter detailed the regrets that Hanlar had, and also the existence of Sophia's half-brother, Kolwyn. Tiran told his mother that Kolwyn had passed away, but that he met him and he seemed like a good boy. Worn out by all this news, Sophia retreated upstairs to her bedroom.</p> <p>Sah-Sauj woke up fully rested and tried to convince Wolf to come along with everyone to look for the \"system disk\" that Tiran needed. However, even though Sah-Sauj insisted he would be fine, Wolf decided it would be safer for him to remain at the forge. Gadot also remained behind, having conceived of a plan to get Wolf out of his current predicament.</p> <p>Tiran, Pasha, and Sah-Sauj set out to town by horse and cart and saw a few Aldarion Unlimited guards loitering on the road. They exchanged hellos and the rest of the trip was uneventful.</p> <p>The survivors camp was quiet since, though the sun was still out, it was late in the evening. You tied the horse up at the survivors' camp stables, and headed to Mike and Hurq's cave where you found the boys asleep in their bedrolls.</p> <p>When Tiran asked them about the \"system disk,\" they didn't know what he was talking about. Sah-Sauj, looking for a way to turn Ramona into a turtle, asked the boys about any witches who could help. They didn't know of any, but did know a weird guy living in the woods who asked them to bring him anything they found near the lake. Mike agreed to take you to him.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Gadot told Wolf about his plans to turn one of Hanlar's old horse deeds into a deed for Ramona to show the magistrate the next day. After taking some time to create it, Gadot was able to create an okay forgery. However, after Wolf told him some more personal details, including his real name, he was able to create a much more convincing copy.</p> <p>In the ancient forest near Cauldin's Point, the other group approached the mouth of the cave from which they could hear distant music emanating. Mike decided to stay outside and wait while the rest of you ventured in. Within, you saw a strange contraption mounted atop a wooden cart. Coils of metal in the cart, and a chair nestled between everything else. Sitting at a table, muttering quietly to a doll, you saw a man in a white coat.</p> <p>Sah-Sauj walked up and confronted the man, who didn't seem surprised to see them and dismissed their appearance. Sah-Sauj asked him if he knew anything about a \"systems disk\", but he said no and asked you to leave. Recognizing the obvious lie, Sah-Sauj began annoying the man by pushing buttons and touching devices strewn about the room. After some more convincing, and the man getting irritated, he handed over the coaster to his coffee cup, which he claimed was the system disk.</p> <p>He said that that the device the disk activated was dangerous, a killing machine, but he didn't care anymore and was fine with whatever the outcome would be of reactivating it. This was made worse by his belief that this reality was a figment of his imagination and each of you a product of his subconscious mind. When pushed about details by Sah-Sauj, he gave some information on where he came from and what happened from his perspective before he ended up here. However, his words didn't make too much sense to you.</p> <p>Now that you had the disk you wanted, he asked you for a favor, which was to power the machine which would take him away from this world.</p> <p>Tiran and Pasha were tasked with finding the power source for the machine and found it at a stream. Sah-Sauj watched as the man climbed on the chair, put a helmet with wires connected to it on his head, and a smaller on his doll. When Tiran and Pasha powered the device on their end, Sah-Sauj watched as the man began to shake and foam from his mouth, and the smell of burning flesh filled the cave. A moment later, he slumped over and fell off the cart, dead on the cave floor.</p> <p>And that's where we left off.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-14/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-15/","title":"Session 15: Booting a Bot","text":"<p>Date: Tuesday, March 22, 2022 @ 9:00 PM CT</p> <p>Audio: MP3 (1h36m, 88MB)</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-15/#synopsis","title":"Synopsis","text":"<p>Before giving Dr. Anton Malchi his last rites and cremating his body, Sah-Sauj searched him for anything useful and found a pen and a wristwatch.

The first party, consisting of Pasha, Tiran, and Gadot, rode off at high speed to the Ironstone Forge, where something was reportedly going down. When they arrived at Cauldin's Point, a worried Weslan Stillwater approached them on horseback, followed by his men. He pointed towards the horizon where black smoke billowed over the treeline in the direction of the Forge. The gang hauled ass down the road towards the smoke.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Wolf and Sah-Sauj remained behind to investigate the nearby camp and quietly crawled through the underbrush to get nearer. A single guard sat at a campfire as the rain poured down. Wolf and Sah-Sauj spotted a wagon, some horses, and a handful of tents encircling the campfire. As Wolf closed in, he noticed that the guard was sleeping and recognized him as Freeney, the bandit who had robbed him of his cigars a year ago. Though Freeney was in a drunken slumber, a light shone from a tent near him. He was not alone.</p> <p>The duo approached the horses and wagon, and Wolf discovered that the reins were not damaged as Jerry had claimed in his lawsuit. They decided to go into the actual camp to collect more evidence. Wolf snuck close to Freeney and quickly subdued him. However, Sah-Sauj stumbled on a rope anchoring the tent with the light inside.</p> <p>Miles away from the camp, the other group arrived at the Ironstone Forge, which was a roaring inferno. The group quickly headed to the main house, where they heard Sophia calling for help somewhere inside.</p> <p>Clank began bashing down the front door to the burning house while Tiran attempted to scale the wall. Before he could do so, his trusty robot broke down the door. Tiran ran inside and looked around. The place was falling apart, so he had to be quick as the fire consumed the wooden inner structure. He followed a trail of blood up the stairs and into his mother's bedroom.</p> <p>Sophia lay unconscious on the floor with a bloody ball-peen hammer in one hand and a leather bag in the other. A dead bandit with a ball-peen hammer-shaped hole in his head laid beside her. The house rumbled beneath Tiran's feet as black smoke billowed upstairs. He grabbed Sophia, opened a window, and jumped out as Pasha cast Feather Fall on him from below. The house collapsed into a pile of burning rubble as he touched the ground with his mother safe in his arms.</p> <p>Weslan Stillwater's healer poured a potion of healing down Sophia's throat, and she regained consciousness long enough to tell them that Jerry had come for Ramona. The gang headed for the stables, where they found a corpse in a puddle of its viscera. A wide of blood led down to the river behind the Forge.</p> <p>They saw Ramona lie motionless by the water at the river, covered in slashes and pierced with countless arrows. Tangled between her sharp horns were the entrails of her victims, yet she wasn't moving. Lying against a tree stump was a fading Burron Piquette, who lamented that Wolf wasn't there to see his handiwork and then unceremoniously died. Stillwater's healer gave a potion of healing to Gadot, who was able to stabilize Ramona with it.</p> <p>Back at the camp, the guard woke up from Sah-Sauj's stumbling. She tried to deceive him by imitating Freeney but was unsuccessful. As the guard got ready to exit the tent, Wolf and Sah-Sauj prepared to knock him out, which they did in a coordinated strike. With the guards dealt with, they searched the camp for clues. Eventually, Wolf found a wanted poster for Jerry and Jim. They were wanted for murder in Kleftmon, dead or alive, with a 500 gp reward each.</p> <p>While getting ready to leave, Sah-Sauj recognized one of the horses as Tiran's missing steed, Percheron. They tied the horses to the wagon and left for the Forge.</p> <p>When they arrived there, Wolf showed Weslan Stillwater the wanted poster that he found. Stillwater told him to hang on to it and present it to the magistrate. He also told Gadot to see him in his tent afterward.</p> <p>Sophia told Tiran that she was leaving for Kleftmon and packing whatever remained of her stuff in the morning. The Forge was gone. As everyone tucked in for the night, Sah-Sauj discovered with Ramona's help that the wand given to her by Bhreia had healing properties. Tiran gifted Percheron to Sah-Sauj, who thanked him but immediately renamed the animal Harry. Harry the Horse.</p> <p>In the morning, Jim tried to make a deal with Wolf after he dumped his friend's corpse next to him. He told Wolf that he could give them money, but Wolf replied that he already had all of his money.</p> <p>The party set out on the road to Cauldin's Point, where Wolf told Tiran that he felt guilty for everything because he had lost his temper after finding Ramona. Tiran said he knew exactly how he felt since he was still angry about his family business' destruction.</p> <p>Upon arriving at the Survivors' Camp, the party brought Jim and Jerry's corpse to the magistrate. After presenting his evidence, the magistrate dropped the charges against Wolf. Wolf was also paid 1000 gp for the bounty on the captives. And, as a show of gratitude, the magistrate wrote deeds for both Ramona and Harry the Horse.</p> <p>Afterward, you visited Weslan Stillwater in his tent. He provided a complete map of Marram to Gadot and helped break down travel costs, equipment, and which route to take. He handed a silver medallion with the Aldarion Unlimited logo to Gadot, which would grant the company's favor when presented.</p> <p>Finally, he told you that it would be a good idea to start a company, which would help with the many liability issues involved in being an adventuring group. And perhaps obtain a bounty hunters' license as well.</p> <p>And that's where we left off.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-17/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-18/","title":"Session 18: Eastbound","text":"<p>Date: Tuesday, May 3rd, 2022 @ 9:00 PM CT</p> <p>Audio: MP3 (2h14m)</p> <ul> <li>Skip recap: 5m50s</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-18/#synopsis","title":"Synopsis","text":"<p>A flashback to several months ago kicked off the last session.

At the end of the line of pens stood a log cabin. Its front door swayed slowly in the breeze. Inside, its wooden floors were caked with dried blood.

The chicken you followed now moved quietly, trying to appease its ill society. Yes, the cavern held a few surprises, youngling dragons of various sizes. Yet, Sah-Sauj approached them without fear, \"we're looking for a girl, is she here?\" The wyvern responded as if from the grave, \"the human girl is in the cave.\" Pasha hid, though not from fright, worried what would happen, stepping into their sight.</p> <p>Well, he didn't have to wait much later, after rounding a corner he heard \"traitor!\" Wyrmlings attacked, shooting bolts of lightning, biting Sebastian -- Oh so very frightening! Arrows cut the air, spells were cast, and a wyrmling felt Gadot's crossbow blast. The melee mixed with magic tricks, and from the entrance appeared the Tiefling Ix.</p> <p>Though they put up a fight, the drakes were slain, at which point, just the hatchlings remained.

Their unformed wings gave a final flutter, as your blades carved them up like butter.</p> <p>Though the cave now seemed clear, on the pond, Ix and Arya did appear. He held his blade up to her throat, and as they sank, her eyes glowed. Light blue, like the color of the sky, like the color of the dragon, the color of its eye.

Arya fought back and petrified Tiran, Gadot, and Wolf. And while petrified, Tiran took blow after blow from Arya, chunking away at his stony form. However, Sebastian was able to eventually strike the killing blow while looking away to prevent getting petrified himself.</p> <p>He searched the girl's body and found a silver dagger and two gold wedding bands in her pocket. Tiran searched the cave and found a pile of decomposing and disarticulated corpses. The glowing pond in the cave slowly went dark and the dragon eggs began to sink. Before they could sink entirely, Tiran took one of the eggs. It strongly resembled Bhreia's egg but was green instead of blue. Gadot found a pouch under a rock containing a hollow stone filled with a liquid that smelled like weapons oil.</p> <p>On the way to Midway, Clank informed Tiran that he only had 15 miles left and needed power. When you arrived in town, Garacan and his wife were happy to hear about your victory and offered free lodging and drinks for life. Garacan also offered to dispose of the girl's corpse and put it out back. After asking about Ix, Pasiphae, Garacan's wife, handed you the keys to his room where you found his backpack. Besides some rations, Sah-Sauj found a rolled-up note containing an address to some kind of compartment in Korban's Landing. While inspecting the backpack a bit closer, Tiran also found a strange retractible spear, which he gave to Gadot.</p> <p>Sah-Sauj went outside and inspected the girl's corpse. She looked to have been magically altered in some way. Gadot mentioned that it reminded him of Moreus, Dauriel's husband, and how he was altered before he transformed.</p> <p>Inside, Tiran was able to identify the oil that Gadot found as a weapons oil used by Stone Giants Ages ago. Sah-Sauj lamented that they should have tried talking to the girl before attacking her. Tiran said that his only regret was not stabbing her a second time. However, he also discussed with the group that ever since he came to Cauldin's Point, he's been feeling aggressive. Gadot confirmed that his recent bloodlust wasn't his normal behavior.</p> <p>That night when you went to bed in the inn, Clank tried to recharge off the little bit of moonlight that trickled in through the window.

He had a quick drink and left without noticing you sitting there. The print only mentioned Tiran and Wolf by name and crude portraits, but nobody else explicitly.

The field surrounding the central statue was empty, and you had the place to yourselves. As night fell, Sah-Sauj took the first watch and soon heard someone approaching. It turned out to be the sick hobo who tried to hire you to steal health potions from an Aldarion Unlimited wagon. A scheme that failed and almost got you all into trouble because someone attempted to take this person's wooden box.</p> <p>Sah-Sauj followed him while Tiran held watch and found the hobo slumped against the back of the statue in the cold dewy grass. His chest rattled with phlegm as he asked who was in the darkness with him. Sah-Sauj thought he looked close to death.

He replied Sah-Sauj, \"you can pry it from my cold dead hands.\"</p> <p>That's when Sah-Sauj decided to speed up that process and took out his spear. The hobo asked him what he was doing as the tip of the spear glinted in the moonlight. \"I'm helping,\" said Sah-Sauj and plunged it into the hobo's heart. As the man's life ebbed away, Sah-Sauj closed his eyes, recited a little prayer to Bhreia, and took the box.</p> <p>Which he was entirely unable to open.</p> <p>Upon returning to the campsite, he asked Tiran if he knew what the box was.

Tiran woke Gadot and talked to him about the transmission and the fact that he hasn't been feeling like himself. Gadot told him that he seemed more bloodthirsty lately. Tiran tells him that the sword he carries requires him to feed it blood or bad things happen. He hasn't fed the sword in 24 hours. Tiran decided not to feed the sword today.</p> <p>That night, Sah-Sauj dreamed that he was flying with a group of dolphins and was having a good old time. Fred, an old acquaintance and Bhreia's brother, showed up during the dream and told him that he could have these dreams every night if he wanted. Sah-Sauj loved the idea. Fred told him that in the morning, he'll notice a present that he gave Sah-Sauj.</p> <p>When Sah-Sauj wakes up in the morning, all of the leaves are removed from Bhreia's wand. But, look at those biceps! Sah-Sauj is swole AF and with a single flex broke the wand in half. He decided to test his strength by flinging the body of the person he murdered across the field. This is also when everybody else learned of Sah-Sauj's deadly escapades that night.</p> <p>The memorial was covered in blood, and while cleaning, you discovered a door. After some fudging around, Tiran found a way to open it and uncovered a staircase leading down below the statue. A room with water flowing from one end to the other led to a half-rotted door. Tiran went first and set off every single trap, but made it nonetheless. Everybody else followed except for Sebastian.</p> <p>Here, he met Korban who has been imprisoned down here for the better part of a millennium inside a glass sphere. Korban explains that the room was used as a portal to other places: a lunar colony, a volcano, Cauldin's Point, and Earth, a wild place filled with humans by Korban's estimation. Korban says that he gave the sword that could open the room was given to Cauldin as a gift. Even though he gave the sword, he said that he couldn't lift the curse for Tiran, but there are words out there that can break the spell.</p> <p>Off on the side, not paying attention to anything else, Sah-Sauj was able to open his box.

While staying in an inn paid for by Dauriel, things began to seem a bit off. A young girl's ghostly apparition led you down to the inn's basement where you found a tunnel leading to a tomb. Here, you uncovered blue cloaks and golden daggers and signs of a cult following an unknown deity named Amalchi operating in the bowels of the town.</p> <p>The next day, Dauriel revealed the real reason he invited you to the party: he needed you to check up on Gadot's father, Phillipe, who had been missing for a while now in faraway Marram. Dauriel feared that the company he founded, but retired from, now had something to do with the ongoing Tabaxi genocide taking place there. He had sent Phillipe to investigate and now his son and his friends in turn.</p> <p>At night, Wolf was visited in his forest camp by a lady carrying a swaddled baby. She wanted to sit by his fire to warm up. Wolf agreed and noticed that the baby was made of soil. When he looked up in the sky, he saw that the world's five moons were coalescing into a single point of bright light, turning night into day for just a moment. When he looked back down, the woman was gone.</p> <p>Dauriel's birthday party was the next day. In a passionate speech in the ballroom of his mansion, Dauriel's husband Moreus, revealed that he knew about his husband's secret desire to go adventuring again. He also knew that the reason he didn't was because of him, being merely a weak mortal. He told the gathered crowd that he heard a voice talk to him from a blue glass sphere in Dauriel's office. They had been talking for a while, becoming friendly, building trust. The voice, he said, promised to give him the strength to allow him to come along on his husband's adventures. Moreus produced the sphere from behind his back, and, while Dauriel screamed in protest, he shattered the sphere in his hand.</p> <p>Moreus became enveloped in tendrils of blue light coming from the shattered orb while one of the tendrils smashed Dauriel into the floor, unconscious. Moreus began to float and you followed his body. Sah-Sauj carried Dauriel and laid him to rest on a couch. His body was badly hurt and encrusted with black stone where the tendril had touched him. Dauriel implored him not to let Moreus descend before he passed out. However, Moreus floated through doors and down a hallway to the basement of the mansion where you found a passageway leading deep into the earth.</p> <p>Far below the mansion and the town, you emerged in a cave with carved out chambers and a tall spire leading up, surrounded by a moat of lava. Here you met a woman who Wolf recognized as the same woman who had visited him at his camp. She revealed herself to be Bhreia, the deity previously thought to have been only a personification of the earth. She offered those who would accept it a gift: a connection with her through nature, and Sah-Sauj a new destiny as a protector of life. She turned Sah-Sauj's holy symbol into a staff resembling a branch with 10 leaves containing healing powers. She disappeared and you continued your pursuit of Moreus.</p> <p>But he was already nowhere to be found. Once you made your way up the spire, you saw Moreus in the hands of cult members wearing blue cloaks, feeding him blood, nurturing something inside him. His skin cracked open with blue energy, his eyes glowing wildly. Something alive gestated within him. All the while you fought the cult members, but despite your valiant efforts, you were unable to stop the inevitable. Moreus burst open like an overcooked sausage and from within, an enormous blue dragon appeared. Amalchi had risen.</p> <p>Amalchi, in dragon form, looked down at you and in Draconic, said: \"I shall grant you the same courtesy that your kind has shown me.\"</p> <p>He enveloped you in his wings and the next thing you saw was a blue void of absolute nothingness. Here you floated until you found what appeared to be a boundary. A sphere. Sah-Sauj remembered dreaming of a place like this where his friend Fred lived. Eventually, you cracked the sphere and for a moment seemed to be observing a conversation between a man and a woman, talking about strange things you didn't understand. Then, suddenly, you were back in the blue void, which appeared cracked all over.</p> <p>You shattered it, broke through, and emerged on a small island in the middle of a debris-cluttered lake. From the remnants there, you deduced that the lake was a crater where the town of Cauldin's Point used to be. Nearby, in the bushes, you found a female corpse, dressed like the strange people you briefly observed in the void. Tiran found a mechanical construct that he vowed to take with him once you made it out safe.</p> <p>You spoke to the survivors of the apparent disaster that struck the town one year ago on the exact same day. A dragon had burst from the earth, destroying the town and locking the sun in the sky. The sun hadn't set for a year. Hundreds had died with more missing and presumed dead, including yourselves as you later found out.</p> <p>Tiran's mother had taken up hold in her family's forge a few miles outside of Cauldin's Point. You reunited with her and her new friend, Agorius, a survivor of the disaster who was helping out at the forge. Here, the two of them constructed semi-magical clocks powered by a crystal that kept track of the actual time now that the sun could no longer do that. These clocks were distributed worldwide, and placed in the centers of cities and towns.</p> <p>You retrieved Tiran's mechanical construct from the crater and brought it back to the forge. However, on the way back, you were ambushed by a young one-eyed dragon, who called Pasha a traitor. The battle nearly killed the dragon who was barely able to escape with his life. Agorius was knocked out and brought back to the forge unconscious.</p> <p>When Pasha and Sah-Sauj laid him down in his bed, they went through his belongings and found items tying him to the cult of Amalchi. Agorius was not who he seemed and was revealed to be Phidippus, one of the cult members they had fought and a powerful magic user who had disguised himself. Pasha and Sah-Sauj found out and restrained him. When Sah-Sauj went to tell the others, Phidippus told Pasha \"I didn't mean for this to happen just yet.\" While moving him outside, Phidippus broke free from Pasha's grasp and disappeared using an invisibility spell.</p> <p>While inspecting the clocks, you found out that the crystals embedded in the devices were corrupted. The crystal was a black obsidian instead of white. When touching the it, some of you were met with visions of a jungle and a foggy ravine holding a shadowy creature within. Tirans mother worried that Phidippus was responsible for it and didn't know why he did this. All she knew was that they had been distributing these devices for almost a year to important settlements all over the world.</p> <p>After some shenanigans in town, which ended up with burning the forge to the ground, you met Sebastian, who turned out to be Tiran's cousin from Ta\u00efni. He had traveled all the way to Cauldin's Point to retrieve Tiran on order of his father. He mentioned that Tiran's father had shown up with a badly hurt elven man, encrusted in black stone all over his body and missing limbs. The elf was kept secretly in a back room of Sebastian's home.</p> <p>With the forge burned down, Tiran's mother returned home and you set out eastward on your way to meet Tiran's father in Ta\u00efni. On the road, you once again faced the same young one-eyed dragon and finally defeated it. Once dead, it dropped its glowing eye, which when looked through, revealed magical objects nearby. That day, the sun set for the first time in a year.</p> <p>A night, while making camp, Bhreia appeared to Pasha and set him on a journey up a nearby mountain to visit an oracle. In the forest on the foothills, he encountered familiar faces who tried to lure him off his path. But Pasha refused. Eventually, he made his way through the forest and up the side of the mountain where he met a young half-elf girl named Kassie, who he helped up the peak even though she wouldn't stop asking him questions.</p> <p>After she finished asking her barrage of questions, they instantly appeared at the temple at the summit. She jumped off Pasha's back and ran inside. Pasha followed and the temple's doors closed behind him. In the darkness, Kassie, the new oracle, revealed visions to him about the past, the state of the present, and potential futures. His experience ended with him being brought back to the camp where Bhreia still sat waiting for him. Only a few minutes had passed while he was gone.</p> <p>Bhreia explained that the world was in peril with her brother Amalchi no longer controlling the sky. She provided a choice for you: The first option was to travel to Amalchi's original plane of existence and somehow seed it with life. The second, to hatch her from an egg, transforming her into a dragon who would help defeat Amalchi. You accepted the second one.</p> <p>On the road, Tiran's mechanical construct, now named Clank picked up on a radio signal from a person named Remo who lived in Rivoni Springs and sounded excited to meet another Earthling. He said that whoever was listening should come visit him.</p> <p>While camping, Sah-Sauj noticed a familiar sick man who held a box that he really really wanted. Using the cover of night, he went over and demanded the box from the man. He refused, so Sah-Sauj killed him and took the box instead of waiting for him to die, which he clearly would have that same night. When going to sleep that night, Sah-Sauj found himself flying through the sky with dolphins and having a great time. The voice of his friend Fred who had been missing from Sah-Sauj's dreams for a while reappeared. Fred told him that he'd have a gift for Sah-Sauj in the morning and that he'd be back in his dreams again from now on.</p> <p>The next morning, Sah-Sauj found that his staff given to him by Bhreia had withered and died. Instead, he was filled with newfound rage and strength that he tried out on the corpse of the person who he'd killed the night before, throwing him across the field on which you had set your camp.</p> <p>While cleaning blood off a statue in the center of the field, you found a tunnel leading down into a chamber that held the imprisoned Korban, namesake of the country you now inhabited. He'd been down there for the better part of a millennium, magically kept alive by his unbreakable prison. In this room, you also found what seemed to be a portal rotating through several destinations, all of which looked unfamiliar except for Cauldin's Point. Though you tried, you could not break Korban free from his prison and were forced to leave him behind, setting back out onto the road.</p> <p>A few days later, you arrived in Korban's Landing, a port city and gateway to your next destination, which brings us to the previous session.</p> <p>Anxious about the bounty on his head, Tiran disguised himself as a woman named Tonya and the rest of you moved through the town towards its center where the wanted posters hung on a board. When you arrived, you found your poster amongst a sea of other wanted posters. Pasha tore the poster from the board and walked off without anyone seeming to care.</p> <p>Tiran remembered that the Minotaur's wife back in Midway had told him about a place where they could stay: Madame Mollisher's. She'd mentioned to tell them that \"Passi\" sent you.</p> <p>Pasha led you to the docks where you entered a tavern named \"The Salt Lick,\" a place frequented by sailors. Though there were a few barflies early in the morning, there weren't any that Pasha recognized. Meanwhile, Sah-Sauj tried to hook Tiran, still disguised at Tonya, up with the half-orc bar maid Ana. They both were very uncomfortable.</p> <p>While having some drinks at the bar, you made plans to do some shopping, investigate Ix's locker, and what to do with your mounts and wagon once you secured passage on a ship.</p> <p>And that's where we left off.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-31/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-32/","title":"Session 32","text":"<p>Date: September 27, 2023</p> <p>While leaving the Salt Lick, you ran into Tom Wake, Pasha's old boss. He looked busy but wanted to meet up with Pasha in the evening to talk about things. When you agreed, he quickly skittered off in the back of the Salt Lick.</p> <p>In town, you had some magical items that you found identified after which you set off to find Ix's mom. In The Haunches, you found a guy playing a guitar named Walker who knew of Ix and his mother. While initially reluctant, he took you to see the old lady.</p> <p>Before Tiran could tell her that her son was dead, Walker interjected and sang her her favorite song. It seemed to take the edge off her a bit, and when Tiran asked about it, she told you what she though the name of the song was.</p> <p>Though when Tiran eventually told her of her son's fate, she told you to get the fuck off her porch. You did, but Pasha left behind the journal of the girl ultimately responsible for her son's death.</p> <p>For a bit of gold, Walker told you the location of the address on your note. Though when you arrived, you realized that you were in the wrong part of town. After some more searching in the Old City, you finally found the address where, once inside, you were lead to a locker which you opened by speaking the passphrase \"From the depths, across the plains.\"</p> <p>Inside you found a bunch of strange items: a gold coin that seemed to weigh things down, a strange bottle made from alligator skin, a matchbox wrapped in twine, a six-pack of potions of greater healing, and a large leathered scrotum containing even more items. Chiefly among them all, a scimitar made of a rough black material, inscribed with words in infernal. None of you knew how to speak infernal though, so you went back to the Salt Lick.</p> <p>Everyone except Gadot, who went to visit a magic shop named the Arcane Attic where he spoke with its owner, Ellegrin Snunders, an elderly gnomish man. He asked Gadot some questions and grew a bit concerned as he heard more details. Gadot was told to bring Tiran and the sword to the shop, perhaps under false pretenses so Ellegrin could figure out the situation and potentially buy the sword if it could be neutralized.</p> <p>In the evening, you met up with Tom Wake at the Salt Lick who brought two companions with him. One of which was Chickadee, Dauriel Aldarion's Tabaxi housekeeper who you met a year ago. She also recognized you and was surprised to learn that you survived the explosion of Cauldin's Point. As she sat down, you noticed that she was holding hands with a human man.</p> <p>Tom wanted Pasha to rejoin the crew since he's fallen on hard time ever since he left and has resorted to taking on passengers to make ends meet. He seemed desperate and offered to make Pasha half owner if he would just rejoin. Pasha said that he could after wrapping up his current affairs.</p> <p>Sebastian asked Tom if he knew of a place where you could acquire dirt from the deepest depths of the ocean. Tom said that you'd need specialized equipment to go there. When asked if he knew anyone with such equipment, he said yes, but was hesitant to give any more information since there would be strings attached. Strings attached to the wrong kind of crowd. Though you said that Tom didn't have to be involved, he said that he'd rather introduce you to the guy who owned the equipment since he wouldn't trust strangers.</p> <p>When Tiran ordered another drink, his eye fell on the portait on the Korbantirian copper piece. A striking resemblance to the man who was sitting with Chickadee. Chickadee filled you in on some of the things that happened while you were in the blue void. The town had exploded and Amalchi in his dragon form had traveled east. In his path, he had destroyed part of the temple of Melora here in Korban's Landing and then resumed east across the water. Nobody had recovered the bodies of Dauriel or his husband Moreus. She spent most of the year in the survivors' camp and left when all hope of seeing Dauriel again was lost and in the face or rising anti-Tabaxi sentiment.</p> <p>She met Callum in Korban's Landing and stayed in the city for a while falling in love and planning to run away together. When Tiran heard the name Callum, he got confirmation that this person was Prince Callum of the royal house of Korbantir. Tiran asked him if he was okay with leaving everything behind, and knowing what he was implying, Callum said that he'd rather leave it behind. Tiran asked if he was afraid that people would come looking for him. Callum said that Marram is a large place and rather unexplored.</p> <p>Wolf, listening to this story, and being distrustful in nature kept a close watch on Callum's mannerisms, but eventually determined that he was sincere. Perhaps naive, maybe stupid, but sincere nonetheless.</p> <p>Tom Wake gave a recommendation to Madame Mollisher's, a place of rest and pleasure, as he put it, and said to meet him at his ship, The Beacon, in the morning to talk business.</p> <p>But before that happened, Tiran bet Tom that the half-orc bar maid, Ana, couldn't pick up the big red nutsack for 5 gold pieces. Reluctant to touch a giant nutsack, she told Tiran to buy her a drink if she could lift it. Though she tugged on Tiran's nutsack with all her might, she could not get a release. But, even though she lost, Tiran bought her a drink anyway. A working girl gets paid.</p> <p>Everyone but Wolf, who went to sleep in the stables with Ramona, went off to Madame Mollisher's.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-32/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-33/","title":"Session 33: Tragedy Seems to Follow Us","text":"<p>Date: October 5, 2023</p> <ul> <li>sold horses (37.5 each)<ul> <li>Tiran</li> <li>Sebastian</li> </ul> </li> <li>Harry the horse and Ramona are being transported to Tiran's mother for 90gp (45 each)</li> </ul> <p>Wolf wanted to spend one more night with Ramona before she was transported to stay with Tiran's mom along with the rest of your horses. While in Ramona's stall, he overheard a conversation between the stable's owner and a group of Aldarion Unlimited guards bringing in a blood-covered wagon. They told the owner that they just finished cleaning up a crime scene at \ud83d\udd10 Korban's Memorial where guards and a civilian were murdered. Once they left, Wolf paid the owner 20gp to send a note to where the rest of you stayed.</p> <p>At the hotel/brothel, you were greeted by Madame Mollisher herself and presented with a selection of prostitutes. Sebastian, Pasha, and Gadot simply rented a room, but both Sah-Sauj and Tiran spent the night with a prostitute -- to varying levels of success.</p> <p>In the morning, you reunited with Wolf and set out for the harbor to meet Tom at his ship, The Beacon. When you arrived, you found a corpse floating in the water between the dock and the ship. It was Prince Callum, whom you had met the night before with Chickadee and Tom at the tavern. Tiran, Gadot and Pasha hoisted the corpse from the water and found a hole in the man's chest about 6\" in diameter, straight through the body. Sebastian noticed that the hole's edges were burned. Pasha looked closely at the hole and discovered that it wasn't caused by magic but by a physical effect. A few guards showed up, but you determined they were just there to keep the peace.</p> <p>Everyone except Sah-Sauj went aboard to look for Chickadee but only found a shit-faced Tom falling out of a hammock and wondering what was happening. When you let him know, and Sebastian sobered him up, he freaked out, knowing damn well who the dead man was. When asked if he heard anything, Tom said nothing unusual except some splashing and what sounded like a cat stuck in the cargo hold. Pasha and Gadot went down in the cargo hold and found a box tagged with the names of Chickadee and Callum. Its insides were scratched up by some creature that had inhabited it. Gadot figured that the box was big enough to hold something the size of a dog or quite a large cat. When looking closely at the thing's construction, he deduced that it was made specifically to hold the creature.</p> <p>Tiran and Sebastian discussed helping get Chickadee out of town or getting themselves out of town. Tiran felt somewhat responsible for Chickadee's situation and thought she might be in trouble now. On the other hand, there was his wanted status to worry about. They decided to discuss this with the rest of the group once they rejoined and not bring any of it up with Tom, who already seemed freaked out.</p> <p>Looking down towards the docks, you noticed more guards approaching, heading directly for the ship. Tiran and Wolf quietly skittered off the side of the ship and swam under a nearby dock.</p> <p>Aboard, the guards placed Tom under arrest for murder and showed Sebastian the warrant. It was legitimate. When Pasha read it, he saw that multiple eyewitnesses gave testimony to seeing Tom murder Callum. As the guards dragged Tom away, he called out to Pasha, \"I guess I won't see you at Gigglemug's tonight.\"</p> <p>Down on the docks, Sah-Sauj was shooed away by the guards but was able to learn that the city was sending its veteran investigators. Sah-Sauj made his plan to get aboard the ship, unaware that Tiran and Wolf just left.</p> <p>The guards deemed the ship part of the crimescene and escorted the rest of you off. As you walked past Callum's body, now laying on his back, Gadot could smell that the hole was burned using a very high-temperature heat source and a there was a lingering smell of ozone. He also noticed that the corpse seemed to be missing its lower jaw. This was sometimes done to prevent spells such as Speak with Dead from being successful.</p> <p>And that's where we left off with the party split in three.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-33/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-34/","title":"Session 34","text":"<p>Date: December 13, 2023</p> <ul> <li>Pasha, Sebastian, and Gadot kicked off the ship</li> <li>Pasha noticed that Callum's hand was clenched tightly</li> <li>They met up with Sah-Sauj in the crowd on the dock</li> <li>They plan to go find Chickadee, perhaps at Gigglemug's</li> <li>Wolf and Tiran escaped</li> <li>Tiran turned Wolf invisible and disguised himself as a city guard</li> <li>While invisible, Wolf joins the group, remaining invisible</li> <li>Tiran, in disguise, joins the guards who are inspecting Callum's corpse</li> <li>Able to fool the detective present, he found a water-damaged note in his hand</li> <li>Meet me at the something-something</li> <li>The detective thanked him for finding the evidence and told him to take the corpse away</li> <li>Tiran carries the corpse with the detective and places it in a wagon</li> <li>The rider tells him to help take it to the morgue</li> <li>The rest of you follow the wagon at a distance</li> <li>The wagon rider takes Tiran to the Aldarion Unlimited compound</li> <li>They take the body down into a subterranean morgue</li> <li>The driver thanked Tiran and left to go fetch the next body</li> <li>Tiran went back down into the morgue, still disguised</li> <li>In Callum's pocket, Tiran found a flask containing a slightly glowing yellow liquid</li> <li>While waiting for Tiran, the rest of you observed the Temple of Dhoutr</li> <li>Black-robed priests came and went, some disappearing in portals before entering the temple proper</li> <li>The portals linger for a few seconds before disappearing</li> <li>The black-robed priests are very similar to the one you fought at Korban's monument</li> <li>Tiran and Wolf got a room at a nearby motel and stayed there, out of sight from anyone who might recognize them during the day</li> <li>Sah-Sauj, Pasha, Gadot, and Sebastian went to Gigglemug's to find Chickadee</li> <li>They got a table, ordered some wine, and by bribing the hostess, found out that Chickadee was staying there</li> <li>While Sah-Sauj distracted the bored Half-Elf at the front desk, Gadot sneaked past and up the stairs where he found Chickadee in her room</li> <li>Gadot told Chickadee that they found Callum dead.

He noticed her child was made of soil. She offered for him to hold it, but he didn't. Looking up into the sky, he noticed that all of the five moons were together in the sky simultaneously, which normally never happens, and moving closer together. As they coalesced into a single bright moon, night turned into day. The woman said \"I believe he is here,\" and as Wolf looked down, she was gone, leaving nothing behind but a few crumbs of soil at the fire. And slowly, night returned.</p> <p>Meanwhile, Gadot was enjoying a restful sleep and dreamed about flying through a daytime sky, high over a dense canopy formed by the many crowns of trees. He slowly descended until he found himself flying through a jungle with ancient trees, gullies, creeks and the fresh smell of new rain. Eventually, he floated along a well-worn path through the forest, until he reached a cliff where he continued to soar along its edge. That is, until he reached a person kneeling at the edge. The person turned around and Gadot saw that it was his father, Phillipe. Phillipe startled when he noticed Gadot behind him, but smiled when he recognized his son. He stood up, and threw himself down the cliff. Gadot followed him down this cliff, flying as fast as he could, pierced through clouds below, only to find himself back in the sky high above the tree canopy and Phillipe was nowhere to be seen.</p> <p>Sah-Sauj dreams of a bright, flashing, light blue light and a voice that said \"you will know me when you see me.\" He woke up for a moment, noticed the five moons, and went back to sleep.</p> <p>Pasha had an uninterrupted night, but was greeted in the morning by a knocking on the door. Junior brought Hurq to his room, whose dirty face was trailed with tears. He said that his buddy Mike wouldn't wake up, no matter how he tried. Pasha told him to stay in his room and while he woke the rest of the gang. Hurq told them that after Oona gave him and Mike \"sleeping tea,\" she wasn't there when he woke up in the morning. Also, all of the Grungs they caught were suspiciously missing.</p> <p>After some shenanigans, everyone headed back up to the boys' cave and found Mike close to death. Sah-Sauj stabilizes him with a spell, but he doesn't wake up. Through the use of some magic, Wolf is able to detect that Mike has been poisoned. Everyone except Tiran and the kids go to town to try and find an herbalist to try and cure this poisoning.</p> <p>In town, everyone goes their separate way and asks around for the herbalist or someone who knows how to handle a Grunge overdose. Everyone is lead to the temple of Primani, and specifically \ud83d\udd10 Londrina, a Dragonborn priestess. While reluctant to help out at first, upon hearing a child is in danger of dying, she gives Sah-Sauj the antidote.</p> <p>Arriving back at the cave, Sah-Sauj immediately administers the antidote and Mike seems to slowly stabilize, but remains unconscious. Knowing that Mike will recover, and that they have nobody to take care of them, you set out to go find a home for them.</p> <p>After lots of asking around, you find some leads to home (slash put into labor) these kids and head off to Dauriel's Party.</p> <p>Borlok greets everyone inside where you find the ballroom filled with guests having a good time drinking, smoking, eating, and chatting it up. After a while of enjoying yourselves, Moreus appears and makes a speech to his husband. He congratulates him and laments the fact that Dauriel can no longer adventure. But, he says, he found a way to allow him to do so again, together, as an adventuring power-couple.</p> <p>From behind his back, he reveals a light blue orb in his hand, which he immediately crushes, sending energy swirling into the ballroom. Windows smash, the ground shakes, strange noises are heard, and Dauriel is severely wounded by one of the energy tendrils. Moreus keels over, but hovers inches above the ground and begins floating out of the room, carried by the blue energy. The crowd flees and scatters out out the ballroom.</p> <p>Borlok and Wolf carry the unconscious Dauriel and lays him on a couch in the drawing room. His chest is encrusted with obsidian, cut where the tendril slashed him. Drunk Sah-Sauj remembers that in his dream, he saw the same blue light as in the orb that Moreus crushed, but doesn't know what it means.

He told him that 35 years ago, deep in the tunnels below the town, Moreus was supposed to be a vessel for a powerful entity to corporealize into this world. However, Dauriel was able to lock the entity's energy into the orb and save Moreus' life, even though his memory was wiped empty. He believed that the entity had been calling to Moreus from the orb, and that's why he had crushed it, setting it free to continue its plans.</p> <p>Dauriel passed out and you all began heading down to the basement where Moreus' body was being led through. His body phased through a wooden door that was locked with a music based puzzle. After only a single wrong entry, Tiran solved the puzzle by completing the tune played by the satyr on your first night in town and selecting the light blue color.</p> <p>The door opened, revealing a long dark natural tunnel formed by a lava tube. You all went down the tunnel until hitting a section that was collapsed, and slowly filling with water. Sah-Sauj and Tiran were able to secure a way through the water by tying a rope and closing the hole that would have filled the tunnel with groundwater.</p> <p>You continued even deeper until the air thinned, but strangely the temperature increased. You arrived at a widened section where the natural structure gave way to a flat stone wall engraved with a strange symbol and two pairs of hand imprints. Sah-Sauj and Pasha put their hands on the imprints and found themselves in control of two large stone statues, tasked with solving a puzzle. A few hours later, and with the input of everyone in the party, the puzzle was solved, but the way back up seemed to be lost.</p> <p>Standing on the other side of the stone room, the only way available seemed to be deeper down the tunnel.</p> DM: Touch Points <ul> <li>Borlok is getting battle ready<ul> <li>Wants to retrieve Moreus</li> <li>Tiran will notice his battleaxe is Ironstone made</li> </ul> </li> <li>Dauriel is still awake and give some background info<ul> <li>His party</li> <li>Moreus, his mind wipe</li> <li>The entity he encountered (Amalchi)</li> <li>after some exposition, he will be conscious for 2 real-time minutes</li> <li>while speaking, the house shakes, part of the tunnel is collapsed</li> </ul> </li> <li>Phidippus is in town, does he know about the orb?</li> <li>Down in the basement<ul> <li>The circular door is locked with the music puzzle</li> <li>the tunnel caved in as Moreus passed<ul> <li>a hole, 20ft deep opened up</li> <li>the rock ceiling fell down into it</li> <li>there is water below</li> <li>there's an irregular tunnel that extends for 30 ft.</li> <li>opens up back onto the path down</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>Half an hour down, down, down<ul> <li>ears pop</li> <li>air gets stale</li> <li>feels old down there</li> <li>natural lava tube?</li> <li>similar quality to Cauldin's Tomb</li> </ul> </li> </ul> DM: Giant Puzzle <ul> <li>A smooth concrete-like wall<ul> <li>amalchi's symbol is carved into the center</li> <li>two sets of hand prints, 20ft. apart</li> <li>BOTH need to be activated to work</li> <li>put hands on prints:<ul> <li>players eyes glow blue</li> <li>they now see through the eyes of two stone golems<ul> <li>each 10ft. tall<ul> <li>one is male, the other female</li> <li>Wolf would notice the female looks like the woman he met</li> <li>Sah-Sauj would know the male looks \"familiar\"</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>ROOM 1: they are in a room<ul> <li>they can see in the dark, but everything is black &amp; white</li> <li>there's a large cube shaped rock</li> <li>there's a large square hole</li> <li>there's a person-sized doorway (looks small to them)</li> <li>they both need to lift the rock and put it in the hole<ul> <li>they need one golem to hold it in place</li> <li>they need one golem to lift the wall</li> <li>the person sized doorway closes up</li> <li>and one of the walls lifts up 2ft.<ul> <li>the others see the wall lift 2ft.</li> </ul> </li> <li>they see TWO MORE handprints<ul> <li>on the floor where the cube was</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> <li>handprints on the floor:</li> </ul> </li> <li>ROOM 2: two more golems activate in the hallway beyond the wall<ul> <li>small: 5ft tall each</li> <li>they are stacked atop each other</li> <li>these move very slowly</li> <li>there's a person-sized exit where the top golem stood</li> <li>there's two handles attached to the wall<ul> <li>they both need to hold it open</li> <li>once open, the wall with the cube rises</li> <li>the cube no longer needs to be held</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-8/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> </ul>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-9/","title":"Session 9: Where's Borlok?","text":"<p>Date: 2022-02-03 @ 9:00 PM CT</p> <p>Audio: MP3 (2h40m)</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/braving-bhreia/sessions/session-9/#synopsis","title":"Synopsis","text":"<p>After finishing the puzzle room, Sah-Sauj was pulled aside by Borlok as you descended deeper down into the ever warming earth. He seemed to probe Sah-Sauj for details on his involvement with Amalchi, and once he deemed that Sah-Sauj was an impostor in his eyes, he blocked you all from going further. However, you easily subdued him and knocked him unconscious.</p> <p>After Borlok was tied up and undone of his clothing, a scarred woman appeared holding a child made of soil, who Wolf recognized as the lady he met in the forest a few nights ago; the earth goddess Bhreia. She implored Sah-Sauj to renounce Amalchi as his deity. He did so reluctantly while not entirely understanding what was happening. Bhreia turned Sah-Sauj's holy symbol into a branch with 10 leaves, it purpose unknown at this point. She offered everyone an embrace, which Sah-Sauj and Tiran accepted. She then laid her child on top of Borlok, embraced both of them, combining them all together into an amalgamation of soil, and leaching into the ground. And she was gone.</p> <p>You all continued down the lava tube tunnel until hitting a dark cavernous space with a lava pool at its center. A pile of blood-drained Macoyii lay rotting at its entrance. At the center of the pool stood a stone spire, feeding streams lava down. There didn't seem to be a way across the pool to the spire that you could discern in the low light conditions.</p> <p>After some looking around the cave, you found five spaces carved into the walls of this cave. Each similar in size and each conceiling a lever in different ways. When all of them were pulled, an obsidian slab rose from the lava, forming a bridge to the spire.</p> <p>However, from an opening in the spire, a blue robed figure appeared.

The polished silver roofs of the palace's many towers glint brightly; a beacon to any traveler on the high seas.

While traveling through the city, Archibald noticed that the temples in the city were devoted to Urlac, the god of war. Not the majority of religious buildings, but every single one of them.</p> <p>Finally, you made it to the palace, where you were led down the main hallway into the throneroom and caught a glimpse of King Gajarta and his two wives before you were whisked away into a small office. Here, you met Yil Romka, advisor to the king, court wizard, man-bun wearer, owner of a creepy staff, and overall just a chill dude.</p> <p>You signed a few more contracts before heading to your private locker room. A corridor lined with doors tagged with various names led you there.

A shimmering blue portal would show up if a job required your attention, and once completed, another portal would appear to return you. Lyle asked if the job's specifics would be apparent before the portal appeared, but Yil told you that it's more of an emergency-type system, so there wouldn't be time for a briefing. After a few dodged questions, Yil left you in your locker room.</p> <p>Lyle cast Detect Magic and found a few magical items. The unopenable door to the locker room, a carving of a small eyeball on its ceiling, and Lyle found some Potions of Healing in a cabinet.</p> <p>Spinny knocked on the door as Yil had suggested, and immediately, a Gnome opened the door and took your orders. After placing a substantial order, which not only included food and drink but also painted portraits, a shimmering blue portal appeared. After an inspiring pep talk by Kheyt, you went through the portal.</p> <p>You end up in a dark and dank cave and follow a narrow passage after lighting up the place. Carved into the cavern's wall, Lyle spotted the same eye symbol and suspected someone was watching them. Following the passageway, eventually, you found a pile of bones from which two animated skeletons rose to attack you. After easily defeating them, Sir Reginald searched the bone pile and found a few metal bangles identical to the ones you're wearing around your wrists and a healing potion.</p> <p>Spinny, continuing down the cave system, found many more bone piles and caught a glimpse of two small creatures in another room down a dark hallway. Steadfast, you entered the bone pile blocking the hallway, and another skeleton rose from it. It shrieked loudly, causing more skeletons to rise from nearby piles, including a massive Minotaur skeleton that instantly knocked out Archibald.</p> <p>The battle was long, but successful, and everyone managed to survive.

It became clear that you were part of an orchestrated contest of some kind, one that kills its contestants.</p> <p>On returning to your locker room, Yil Romka visited and answered your questions with a reassuring smile and plenty of lies. Once he left, you popped your goblin from its hole and debated its fate. Meanwhile, a healer entered and fixed up your combat wounds. However, she noticed your goblin right out in the open. Instead of screaming for help or ratting you out, she offered assistance in finding the truth. She told you to meet her at the Eastern temple of Urlac in the place where there's a sign of life where all else is dead.</p> <p>Eventually, you head out into the city for the first time and without supervision. With the goblin back in his hole, you walked to the Eastern gate, where you released him back into the wild as stealthy as possible. As stealthy as Spinny managed, at least. After a tearful goodbye, Lyle cast invisibility on the goblin, which was the last time you saw him.</p> <p>Next, you visited the temple where you found four mausoleums, one marked with the name Arts, Beaton H., a sign of life where all else is dead. However, the gate to the mausoleum was locked. With a twirl and a flourish, Sir Reginald Featherbottom III made his way onto the roof and inside through an air vent. He unlocked the door from the inside, and eventually (after many strength checks), the slab was pushed off the sarcophagus, revealing a staircase leading down.</p> <p>Once down the narrow staircase, you came upon a heavy wooden door. When you knocked, a panel slid aside, and an Orcish voice prompted you with a riddle.</p> <p>You only get me once and I'm too easily lost. I'm often taken for granted, though I can't be replaced. Some abandon me on purpose, while others want me longer than possible. What am I?</p> <p>After some thought, Lyle answered, \"life,\" and the door swung open. Behind the door, a chamber revealed itself, and within it was the healer who asked you to come here. She explained that she dedicated her life to stopping the government-run games. She believes the games are a front for something more sinister, though she doesn't know exactly what. Though, she thinks that it may have something to do with the devout worship of Urlac and the conspicuous lack of war in Silubria while the continent remains bloodsoaked.</p> <p>And here, in the ground underneath an abandoned temple, is where we left off.</p>"},{"location":"campaigns/slay-inc/sessions/session-4/#categories","title":"Categories","text":"<ul> <li>Sessions</li> <li>Slay, Inc.</li> </ul>"},{"location":"character-creation/character-options/","title":"Character Options","text":"<p>Info</p> <p>More to come soon.</p>"},{"location":"character-creation/character-options/#divine-manipulation","title":"Divine Manipulation","text":"<p>If you wish, feel free to choose one Divine Manipulation, any of which provide a benefit as well as a detriment.

Some of ancient forests still remain, but many have been cut down for timber over the years.</p> <p>It wasn't until the Second Age that the large landmass fractured and Korbantir's shape was finalized. During this Age, the first Human settlements appeared around Korbantir's central lakes and it is thought that this area is the cradle of Humankind on Bhreia.</p> <p>As humans expanded their territory along the peninsula, they came into contact with the Elves of Darvia, who had crossed the Three Brothers sea under the leadership of the Elf simply known as Korban. Humans and Elves made first contact at what is now known as the town of Korban's Landing in 1821. The regional Human tribal leaders, Cauldin of Leikon and his brother, Donitar of Leikon welcomed the Elves into their homes and paved the way for the intermingling of Elves and Humans now so common in Korbantir. Both the country and the sea which Korban navigated are now named after him.</p> <p>However, during this period, Korbantir was roughly divided into two regions, the Western half of it was named Vesperlenda (roughly translated, Western Land), and the Eastern half Sunuzbern (roughly translated Sun Born or Sun Birth).</p> <p>During the Third Age (which was marred by war and conflict between the many races) both regions kept a relative peaceful stance. Shortly after the start oft he Third Age, the two halves joined as Korbantir (see Politics below). There were some border skirmishes along the southern border, but in general, the country didn't see much conflict during the Age. Many attribute this to the development of a liberal multicultural society, others simply due to the fact that the country was difficult to attack because of its nautical borders ringed with many cliffs and difficult to traverse terrain. During this Age, Korbantir was one of the few places to prosper and became a home for many who craved neutrality above all else.</p> <p>Yet, there were those Humans who mistrusted the growing influence of outsiders and feared the erosion of Human culture in what was thought to be the birthplace of Humanity. On one evening in 2208, night fell and and the sun did not reappear for many days. The world grew colder and Korban, who was in his latter years at this point, traveled eastward from Cauldin's Point to Korban's Landing where he was ambushed midway by a group of Humans who assassinated him. Hours after the assassination, the sun rose once more. This period of darkness is referred to as The Many Days of Night and still goes unexplained. The forest where he was slain is now named Korban's Ruin.</p> <p>The assassination of Korban has lead to increased strain between the Human and Elven civilizations, though Korbantir remains a deeply integrated society into the Fourth Age thanks to the historical efforts of Korban.</p>"},{"location":"geography/countries/korbantir/#politics","title":"Politics","text":"<p>Korbantir is a monarchy.

Due to unknown reasons (though some claim a family curse), the Leikon bloodlines ran dry and eventually neither half was left with an heir. The final Leikon heir died in 2052.</p> <p>The nobles of Korbantir worked together to find a suitable replacement, but could not find one in the midst of their own bickering. They enlisted the help of Korban, who proposed a Half-Elf nobleman named Kaylan Dranathi whose parents were both of Darvian and West Korbantirian descendance. He proposed a marriage between Kaylan and a Half-Elf noblewoman named Allebeth Lethson, whose parents were of Darvian and East Korbantirian descendance.</p> <p>Several nobles feared that this union would present a threatening Darvian influence and a dilution of Human influence. However, since both Kaylan and Allebeth were born and raised in Korbantir, the majority ruled in favor of the union. With their marriage, the monarchy became established in 2081 and, again with some resistance that eventually proved fruitless, they named their country Korbantir in honor of the Elf who was responsible for their unification.</p> <p>This royal house, named the House of Dranathi-Lethson currently still rules over Korbantir.</p>"},{"location":"geography/countries/korbantir/#royal-family","title":"Royal Family","text":"<p>The current (3079) royal family:</p> <ul> <li>King Kaylan VI, age 89</li> <li>Queen Bexatria, age 73<ul> <li>Crown Prince Kaylan, age 52</li> <li>Prince Callum, age 43</li> <li>Princess Maruka, age 34</li> <li>Princess Anjanna, age 28</li> <li>Princess Kassina, age 11</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Keeping with tradition, all kings have been named Kaylan and all marriages have resulted in Half-Elven offspring.</p>"},{"location":"geography/countries/korbantir/#geography","title":"Geography","text":"<ul> <li>Mountains<ul> <li>Mendunon (Mountain of the Gods, PIE: men-dyu &amp; -non suffix)</li> <li>Kleftmon (Cleft Mountain, PIE: gleubh-men, bastardized)</li> </ul> </li> <li>Rivers and lakes<ul> <li>TODO</li> </ul> </li> <li>Notable Ancient Forests<ul> <li>Korban's Ruin, east of Cauldin's Point</li> <li>Ravenwold, north of Crabpot</li> <li>Lagermend Forest north of Forisden</li> <li>Wesfirth Wilds, most of Korbantir's North West coast</li> <li>Lake Valley Woods, south-east of Leecham</li> </ul> </li> </ul>"},{"location":"geography/countries/korbantir/#demographics","title":"Demographics","text":"<p>Though the country is home to many races of Peoples, the majority are Humans, followed closely by Elves.</p>"},{"location":"geography/countries/korbantir/#settlements","title":"Settlements","text":"<p>Notable settlements only; there are numerous smaller villages not listed.</p> <ul> <li>Donitar , capital of Korbantir and named after one of the first human tribesmen, Donitar of Leikon.</li> <li>Kleftmon, a large city built around a deep chasm in a mountain top.</li> <li>Mendunon, a city build on top of a mountain, near hot springs.</li> <li>Almaris, a border town thriving on import and export</li> <li>Basford, a port town bordering the Wesfirth Wilds.</li> <li>Cauldin's Point, a town that serves as an agricultural hub, named after Cauldin of Leikon.</li> <li>Crabpot, prime exporter of Korbantirian Crab.</li> <li>Forisden, known for its intense hunting expeditions and high quality game, south of the Lagermend Forest.</li> <li>Hindramon, the largest northernmost town, known for its scenic rivers and untouched wilderness.</li> <li>Hithe, a town slowly descending in poverty as the seas surrounding it are being depleted from overfishing.</li> <li>Korban's Landing, historical landing spot of Korban and common entry point for immigrants.</li> <li>Leecham, the largest supplier of fresh water fish in the country.</li> <li>Leikon, a lake town that's supposedly one of the first Human settlements.</li> <li>Salwen, build atop a high cliff face and producer of salt.</li> <li>Dimeola, the sole town on an island in the Sea of Korban.</li> <li>Midway, a village halfway between Cauldin's Point and Korban's Landing</li> </ul>"},{"location":"geography/countries/korbantir/#public-places","title":"Public Places","text":"<ul> <li>The Lost Port: A port town that sunk into the Blessed Pass after a large earthquake hit the town during the Second Age.</li> <li>Giant Steps: Enormous footsteps in the side of a hill, thought to have been placed there by giants long ago.</li> <li>Royal Gardens: built by the Korbantirian royal family hundreds of years ago for the populous to enjoy.

His feet hurt, and his waterskin was empty, but the end was in sight as he crested the final hilltop and looked down into the valley before him. A river cut through the landscape and emptied into the sprawling lake that stretched beyond the horizon. On its surface, he could make out the red and white striped sails of fishing vessels setting out with the break of dawn. The straps of his backpack cut into his shoulders, but as he spotted the rooftops of the town of Leikon on the lake shore, he knew he would soon be resting at the warm hearth of the Potted Pike Inn.</p> <p>The forest ended abruptly as he passed the logging camps that would soon be swarmed with local loggers once the sun climbed higher. Branches lay strewn about in the artificial clearing, still littered with wood shavings and pine needles from trees systematically cut up and hauled off. Pines grew tall in Korbantir, and the old growth of the Leikon Valley proved an irresistible prize to the locals. The logs would be fed across the lake and down the river towards the capital city of Donitar, where they'd be dried, sawn, and transformed into ships, furniture, or the robust skeletons of upper-class homes.</p> <p>For the fifth time this hour, Aryn reached into his pocket, where his fingers landed on the copper token he'd received in Cauldin's Point two days earlier. It was still there. \"Good,\" he whispered to himself and smiled as he gently bounced the heavy token in the palm of his hand. With the tip of his index finger, he traced the outlines of the swirling dragon figure embossed on one of its faces. It was a shame, he thought, that he'd have to trade such a pretty thing, but his fortune depended on it. He squeezed the metal disk in his fist and dropped it to the bottom of his pocket as he hailed the stout guard at the wooden wall surrounding the town.</p> <p>\"Primani blesses us with another fine morning,\" Aryn called out to the guard, whose eyes were red with either exhaustion or the side effect of a substance meant to stave off sleep or solitude. A faint scent of Fish Valley Rum greeted Aryn as he approached and spotted a few empty bottles poking out from under a bush.</p> <p>\"What's your business?\" The guard asked in a bored and practiced tone. He strolled over, blocking the gated entrance to the best of his abilities.</p> <p>\"I'm meeting a friend at the Potted Pike, sir,\" Aryn said and felt the soles of his feet tingle now that he'd stopped walking for the first time in hours. Maybe he wasn't as fresh as he thought. \"Then off to Kleftmon in a day or two, back on the road.\"</p> <p>\"Passing through then?\"</p> <p>\"Yes, passing through, sir,\" he said and smiled, trying to look as unintimidating as he could for a person his size. Aryn was only a quarter Orc but retained his ancestor's imposing stature and rough features. Not the best look in a country dominated by snooty Elves and Humans, he thought while the tingling in his feet slowly turned into needles.</p> <p>\"Well,\" the guard said and stepped forward while leaning on his halberd. \"I've got some bad news for you. We've had to close the town to visitors.\"</p> <p>\"Why?\" Aryn asked and heard the volume of his voice rising. Control yourself, he thought and squeezed the copper token in his pocket. \"I've got nowhere else to go, and I'm out of food.\"</p> <p>\"Not my problem, bud,\" the guard said and tightened his grip around the halberd.</p> <p>\"Listen, I don't want any trouble,\" Aryn said as he observed the guard tensing up. Only one-quarter Orc, but still regarded as an instant danger almost everywhere he went. \"Is there nothing I can do?\"</p> <p>\"You'll just have to keep going,\" the guard said but didn't loosen his grip. \"There's a town eastward called Cauldin's Point. I'm sure you'll be able to find lodging there.\"</p> <p>\"But that's where I just came from,\" Aryn yelled and didn't realize until after. Shit. Lower your voice. \"Sir, it's two days away, and I'm meeting someone at the Potted Pike tonight.\"</p> <p>\"Calm down, sir,\" the guard said calmly, yet lowered his weapon towards Aryn. \"I understand your frustration, but that's how it is. Now, get going before things get out of hand.\"</p> <p>Shit. One last thing to try, he thought and closed his eyes. It could be stupid. Very stupid. Aryn sighed as he reached his hand into his pocket and pulled out a leather coin pouch. \"Kind sir, I don't suppose you--\"</p> <p>\"--Are you trying to bribe me?\"</p> <p>\"N-no, of course not, I am just--\"</p> <p>\"--Callum,\" the guard yelled towards the town's gate. \"I need backup.\"</p> <p>Shit. Yes, very stupid.</p> <p>Three sleepy guards appeared from the gate carrying swords and pikes. \"Look at this,\" the red-eyed guard called out to his colleagues and laughed. \"He's bribing me!\"</p> <p>The guards pointed their weapons at Arryn.</p> <p>\"Sir, you are under arrest.\"</p> <p>Shit.</p>"},{"location":"stories/wip/part-2/","title":"Two: Ix","text":"<p>For a Tiefling, Ix had always possessed an unexplainable attraction to the cold.

His cell was one of six, crudely carved into the ashen bedrock beneath the guard barracks. Two other cells besides his were occupied.</p> <p>His first neighbor was hard to miss. In the flickering torch light, a middle-aged half-elf woman sat on the cold, rocky floor of the opposing cell, dressed in a long black skirt and a shapeless red tunic. She simply stared at him while running her fingers across the iron bars. There was a rhythmic plonk-plonk-plonk as they steadily swept back and forth, changing the pitch with each pass of her fingers. It sounded faintly musical to Aryn. She hadn't said a word to him, but there was a snide little smirk on her face that hadn't faded yet. She studied him, he thought. Trouble.</p> <p>His second neighbor was obscured by a wall, but what he did see confused him. A pair of large, dirt-caked hooves poked from between the bars. Occasionally, they twitched and kicked as deafening snores erupted, reverberating off every surface in the cells.</p> <p>Aryn leaned back against the wall and instinctively reached into his pocket. His token was no longer there. Neither was his coin purse nor any of his belongings other than the clothes he wore. His meeting at the Potted Pike wasn't going to happen. Depending on the local laws, this could end badly. He'd been locked up before, but never for bribing a guard. Usually, they'd gladly take the money. This was a first.</p> <p>Plonk-plonk-plonk. Pitched a bit higher this time. The half-elf's smirk widened into a grin. Plonk-plonk-plonk-crack. She looked up. \"Ah, there you go, darling,\" she said in a slightly nasal tone as a piece of rock fell from where the bars were mounted into the wall. She picked up the tiny piece, rose to her feet, stretched, and lounged on her cot, inspecting her fingertips. \"It looks like you've got a short stay, stranger,\" she said, flicking the rock across the corridor in his direction. It bounced off his shoe and pecked him painfully inside his thigh. She locked eyes with him again. \"You must have really pissed someone off to end up in there.\"</p> <p>\"I guess so,\" Aryn said and rubbed the sore spot. \"What do you mean by 'short stay?'\"</p> <p>\"Oh darling,\" she said and leaned forward, smiling. \"They don't put a cot or a bucket in your cell because you won't need them. See, us,\" she said while pointing her thumb to the wall, beyond which lay the hoofed snorer. \"We're just here on an extended stay due to a,\" she paused and considered her words for a moment, \"technical misunderstanding. But you? My greenish friend, you'll swing from a rope by sunset today.\"</p> <p>\"What?\" Aryn yelled out and leaped to his feet. \"They'll kill me for bribing a guard?\"</p> <p>The half-elf leaned back against her wall and laughed. \"Don't you know what happened in Leikon? The reason the town locked down?\"</p> <p>\"I guess not.\"</p> <p>\"Oh no, darling, that's unfortunate. Where are you from?\"</p> <p>He considered telling her the truth for a moment. \"Cauldin's Point.\"</p> <p>\"And somehow you've avoided news of Leikon that close by?\" She laughed. \"Sister towns in the heart of Korbantir? Come on, orcling, you can't expect me to believe that.\"</p> <p>\"I don't keep up with the news.\"</p> <p>\"Sure, that, or you're just a terrible liar.\"</p> <p>A door opened somewhere above them. The bustling noise of street life flooded the jail.</p> <p>\"Keep it quiet down there,\" a gruff voice yelled down.</p> <p>The door slammed shut, and for a moment, Aryn and the half-elf woman sat looking at each other in silence. Silently, she rose from her cot and ran her fingers across the bars again. Plonk-plonk-plonk, followed by more pieces of rock falling to the floor. \"Well, darling,\" she said while repeating the movement. \"How would you like to get out of here?\"</p>"},{"location":"stories/wip/part-4/","title":"Part Four: ??","text":"<p>TODO</p>"},{"location":"categories/meta/","title":"Category: Meta","text":""},{"location":"categories/meta/#pages-in-category-meta","title":"Pages in category \"Meta\"","text":"<ul> <li>Calendar</li> <li>Character Options</li> <li>Draconic</li> <li>Dragons</li> <li>Ghukliak</li> <li>Grave Desire</li> <li>History of Bhreia</li> <li>History of The First Age</li> <li>History of The Fourth Age</li> <li>History of The Second Age</li> <li>History of The Third Age</li> <li>Old Common</li> <li>Picking a Country</li> <li>Setting Overview</li> <li>The Wasting</li> <li>Timeline</li> <li>Welcome to Bhreia</li> </ul> <p>All Categories</p>"},{"location":"categories/character-creation/","title":"Category: Character Creation","text":""},{"location":"categories/character-creation/#pages-in-category-character-creation","title":"Pages in category \"Character Creation\"","text":"<ul> <li>Character Options</li> <li>Cuniko</li> <li>Picking a Country</li> <li>Welcome to Bhreia</li> </ul> <p>All Categories</p>"},{"location":"categories/adventures/","title":"Category: Adventures","text":""},{"location":"categories/adventures/#pages-in-category-adventures","title":"Pages in category \"Adventures\"","text":"<ul> <li>Adventure Ideas</li> <li>Dauriel's Mansion</li> <li>The Sentinels of Silubria</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Blue Skies</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 PSA</li> </ul> <p>All Categories</p>"},{"location":"categories/blue-skies/","title":"Category: Blue Skies","text":""},{"location":"categories/blue-skies/#pages-in-category-blue-skies","title":"Pages in category \"Blue Skies\"","text":"<ul> <li>Hanlar Ironstone</li> <li>Human Trinity</li> <li>Mike Truk</li> <li>Motivations</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Blue Skies</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Borlok Orsel</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Breaking Bhreia</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Cauldin's Point Crater</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Chickadee of the Two Rivers</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Dauriel's Letters to Hanlar</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Dr. Anton Malchi</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Dr. Malchi, I Presume?</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Ejol's Emporium</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Forlorn Freeney</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Hanlar's Letter to Sophia</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Hatching Bhreia</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Ironstone Forge</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Ix's Locker</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Ix's Mother</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Korban</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Korban's Memorial</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Leca Zan</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Londrina</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Madame Mollisher's</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Malachi Medeid</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Pasha's Path</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Pastorale</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Phidippus</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Phillipe J'Dogeaux</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Prince Callum</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Road Squid</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Sophia Medeid</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Survivors' Camp at Cauldin's Point</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 The Hanlar and Phidippus Incident</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 The Swamp Witch</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Thomas Wake</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Weslan Stillwater</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Wolf's House</li> </ul> <p>All Categories</p>"},{"location":"categories/handouts/","title":"Category: Handouts","text":""},{"location":"categories/handouts/#pages-in-category-handouts","title":"Pages in category \"Handouts\"","text":"<ul> <li>Boobli Skurk</li> <li>Branch With 10 Leaves</li> <li>Cauldin's Sword</li> <li>Collapsible Spear</li> <li>Dagaz' Eye</li> <li>Dauriel's Invitation</li> <li>Golden Signet Ring</li> <li>Grungine</li> <li>Ironstone Forge Greataxe</li> <li>Lyrics to the Song</li> <li>Marram Map</li> <li>Owlbear Brandy</li> <li>Parasol of Opacity</li> <li>Pelang Box</li> <li>Potion of False Death</li> <li>Ring of Bleeding</li> <li>Swykr Oil</li> <li>Weasel-Skin Anklet</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Bhreia's Embrace</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Borlok's Letter</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Cauldin's Journal</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Cauldin's Sketches</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Dauriel's Letters to Hanlar</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Hanlar's Letter to Sophia</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 Jonah's Journal</li> <li>\ud83d\udd10 MLSD Mk.
